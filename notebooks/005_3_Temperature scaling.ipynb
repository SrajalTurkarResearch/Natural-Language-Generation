"# Comprehensive Guide to Temperature Scaling in Natural Language Generation (NLG)\n\n",
"As a synthesis of minds like Alan Turing, Albert Einstein, and Nikola Tesla, this notebook serves as your advanced laboratory for exploring temperature scaling in NLG. Designed for aspiring scientists and researchers, it builds upon foundational theory with practical code, visualizations, projects, and forward-thinking insights. We'll cover everything from basics to cutting-edge applications, ensuring you have the tools to innovate.\n\n",
"Note: Run cells sequentially. Required libraries: numpy, matplotlib, torch (for PyTorch examples). If not available, install via pip (but in this env, they are pre-installed).\n\n",
"## Section 1: Theory Recap and Deep Dive\n",
"Recall: Temperature scaling adjusts the softmax probabilities in language models to control output diversity.\n",
"- Softmax with Temperature: $ p_i = \\frac{e^{z_i / T}}{\\sum_j e^{z_j / T}} $\n",
"- Low T: Sharp distribution, deterministic outputs.\n",
"- High T: Flat distribution, stochastic outputs.\n\n",
"Rare Insight: In statistical mechanics (Einstein's domain), temperature relates to Boltzmann distribution—here, it's analogous, where 'energy' is negative logit, explaining why high T increases 'entropy' in generations.\n\n",
"What We Didn't Include in the Initial Tutorial (Necessary for Scientists):\n",
"- Calibration: Temperature can calibrate model confidence (e.g., in ECE - Expected Calibration Error).\n",
"- Ensemble Methods: Combine with bagging for robust NLG.\n",
"- Theoretical Bounds: Use information theory (Kullback-Leibler divergence) to measure how T affects divergence from true distribution.\n",
"- Hardware Considerations: High T increases sampling time in inference due to more uniform sampling.\n"
