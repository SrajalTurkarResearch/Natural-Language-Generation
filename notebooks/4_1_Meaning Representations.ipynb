    "## 1. Theory: Understanding Meaning Representations in NLG\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is NLG?\n",
    "Natural Language Generation (NLG) is the process of generating human-readable text from structured data or abstract representations. It’s like a chef turning raw ingredients (data) into a meal (text).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Meaning Representation (MR)?\n",
    "An MR is a structured format capturing the core meaning of a sentence, independent of language or grammar. It’s like a recipe listing key ingredients (entities, actions) without specifying how to phrase them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- Sentence: \"John eats an apple.\"\n",
    "- MR: `eat(John, apple)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of MRs\n",
    "1. **Semantic Frames**: Event-based with roles (e.g., Agent, Theme).\n",
    "   - Example: `Buy: Agent=Alice, Theme=book, Location=bookstore`\n",
    "2. **Predicate-Argument Structures**: Action and entities.\n",
    "   - Example: `chase(cat, mouse)`\n",
    "3. **Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)**: Graph-based, flexible.\n",
    "   - Example: `(w / want-01 :ARG0 (b / boy) :ARG1 (e / eat-01 :ARG0 b :ARG1 (p / pizza)))`\n",
    "4. **Logical Forms**: Formal logic for reasoning.\n",
    "   - Example: `∀x (dog(x) → bark(x))`\n",
    "\n",
    "### NLG Pipeline\n",
    "1. **Content Planning**: Create MR from data.\n",
    "2. **Sentence Planning**: Structure MR into sentence outline.\n",
    "3. **Surface Realization**: Generate natural text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy**: Building a house—MR is the blueprint, NLG adds walls and decor."
