        "This Jupyter Notebook is designed as a timeless resource—your '100-year blueprint' for mastering responsible NLG deployment. It starts from fundamentals, builds to advanced concepts, and includes everything needed to think, experiment, and innovate like a world-class scientist. We'll cover theory with mathematical rigor, practical code (tested in Python 3 environments), visualizations (using Matplotlib and other tools), real-world applications, rare insights from 2025 research, projects on actual datasets, exercises with solutions, and forward-looking directions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why This Notebook? Standard tutorials often miss interdisciplinary ethics, long-term sustainability, and hands-on research tools. Here, we fill those gaps with legal considerations, environmental math, and emerging trends like AI agents in NLG. Update it with new data/papers as NLG evolves—it's built to last.\n",
