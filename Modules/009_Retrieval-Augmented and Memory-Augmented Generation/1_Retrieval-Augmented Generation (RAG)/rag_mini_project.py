"""
rag_mini_project.py - Mini project to build a personal knowledge base RAG system.

Purpose: Create a RAG system for your personal notes, simulating a researcher's workflow
to query and summarize knowledge. This is a beginner-friendly project to practice RAG.

For Scientists: Treat this as a lab experimentâ€”collect data, index it, and query like
Tesla testing a new circuit.
