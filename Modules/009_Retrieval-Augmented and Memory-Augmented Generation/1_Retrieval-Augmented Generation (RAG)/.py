# How to Use These Files

# Setup Environment: Install dependencies: pip install langchain transformers sentence-transformers faiss-cpu torch matplotlib pandas numpy scikit-learn datasets.
# File Execution:

# Run rag_setup.py to test embeddings.
# Use rag_knowledge_base.py to create a vector store.
# Execute rag_retrieval_generation.py for a full RAG pipeline.
# Run rag_visualizations.py for embedding plots.
# Try rag_mini_project.py with your own notes (create a notes.txt).
# Use rag_major_project.py for a climate research demo.
# Run rag_exercises.py for hands-on learning.


# Case Studies: Save case_studies.md and review for real-world inspiration.
# Research Tips (Einstein-inspired): Experiment with parameters (e.g., k, model size). Log results like a lab notebook. Hypothesize improvements (e.g., better embeddings).
# Dependencies: Replace "your_token_here" in rag_setup.py with a Hugging Face API token if using cloud models, or use local models (e.g., via transformers).
