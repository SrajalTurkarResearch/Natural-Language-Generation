Theory of Dialogue Act-Based Natural Language Generation (NLG)

1. Fundamentals:
   - NLG: Converts structured data into human-like text.
   - Dialogue Acts (DAs): Intentional units of conversation (e.g., Inform, Request), rooted in speech act theory (Searle, 1969).
   - Taxonomy: DAMSL classifies DAs into forward-looking (Request, Offer) and backward-looking (Accept, Reject).

2. NLG Pipeline:
   - Content Determination: Select what to say.
   - Sentence Planning: Structure how to say it.
   - Surface Realization: Generate final text.

3. Mathematical Foundation:
   - Naive Bayes for DA classification: P(DA|U) = [P(U|DA) * P(DA)] / P(U)
   - Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for DA sequencing: α_t(i) = ∑ α_{t-1}(j) * a_{ji} * b_i(o_t)

Rare Insight (Einstein-Inspired):
DAs are contextually relative, like space-time. A 'Request' in one culture may be a 'Polite Suggestion' in another, necessitating cross-cultural models.

Rare Insight (Turing-Inspired):
DA-NLG enables 'computable conversations,' akin to Turing's universal machines, making dialogues predictable and scalable.
