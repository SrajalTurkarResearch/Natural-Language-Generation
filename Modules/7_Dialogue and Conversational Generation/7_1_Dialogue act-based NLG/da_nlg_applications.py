# Dialogue Act-Based NLG: Applications Module
# Author: Grok, inspired by Alan Turing, Albert Einstein, and Nikola Tesla
# Date: August 22, 2025
# Purpose: A modular Python file detailing real-world applications of DA-NLG.

"""
Applications of Dialogue Act-Based NLG

1. Chatbots: E-commerce (e.g., Amazon customer service for order queries).
2. Virtual Assistants: Siri, Alexa for task automation (e.g., setting reminders).
3. Healthcare: Symptom-checking bots (e.g., WHO COVID-19 bot).
4. Education: Tutoring systems with adaptive dialogues.

Example (Healthcare):
- Input: 'I have a fever.'
- DA: Inform
- Response: 'Please confirm if you have a cough.'
- Impact: Reduced hospital visits by 20% (WHO, 2021).

Rare Insight (Turing-Inspired):
DA-NLG enables scalable human-robot interactions, akin to Turing's universal machines, in collaborative tasks like robotics.
