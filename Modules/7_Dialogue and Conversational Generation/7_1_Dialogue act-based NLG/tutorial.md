## 1. Basics of NLG and Dialogue Acts

### 1.1 What is Natural Language Generation (NLG)?

NLG is the process of generating human-like text from structured data or internal system representations. It’s like a computer “speaking” in a way humans can understand.

**Analogy**: Think of NLG as a chef turning raw ingredients (data) into a delicious dish (text). The chef follows a recipe (algorithm) to ensure the dish is appealing and appropriate for the occasion.

**Example**:

- Input: Data = {Temperature: 25°C, City: London}
- Output: “It’s 25°C in London today.”

### 1.2 What are Dialogue Acts?

Dialogue acts (DAs) are the intentions or purposes behind a speaker’s utterance in a conversation. They capture _what_ someone is trying to achieve, not just the words they use.

**Common Dialogue Acts**:

- **Inform**: Sharing information (e.g., “The train leaves at 3 PM.”).
- **Request**: Asking for something (e.g., “Can you check the train schedule?”).
- **Greet**: Starting a conversation (e.g., “Hi, how’s it going?”).
- **Confirm**: Verifying information (e.g., “So, the train is at 3 PM, right?”).

**Analogy**: Dialogue acts are like moves in a board game. Each move (utterance) has a purpose—advancing, defending, or redirecting—and shapes the game’s flow (conversation).

### 1.3 Dialogue Act-Based NLG

This approach involves generating text based on a specific dialogue act and its associated content. The system identifies the user’s intent (dialogue act), selects relevant information, and produces a natural response.

**Example**:

- Input: Dialogue Act = Inform, Content = {TrainTime: 3 PM}
- Output: “The train leaves at 3 PM.”

**Real-World Relevance**: Used in chatbots, virtual assistants, and automated systems to ensure responses are contextually appropriate and coherent.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 Components of Dialogue Act-Based NLG

The process typically involves three stages:

1. **Content Planning**: Deciding _what_ to say (e.g., selecting the dialogue act and information).
2. **Sentence Planning**: Structuring _how_ to say it (e.g., choosing tone, sentence structure).
3. **Surface Realization**: Generating the final text (e.g., using templates or models).

**Analogy**: Building a house:

- **Content Planning**: Choosing what rooms to include (kitchen, bedroom).
- **Sentence Planning**: Designing the layout and style of the rooms.
- **Surface Realization**: Adding paint and furniture to make it livable.

### 2.2 Dialogue Act Taxonomies

Dialogue acts are organized into taxonomies, such as **DAMSIL** or **ISO 24617-2**. These categorize acts based on their function:

- **Forward-Looking**: Actions that drive the conversation forward (e.g., Request, Offer).
- **Backward-Looking**: Responses to prior utterances (e.g., Accept, Reject).
- **Task-Related**: Related to the conversation’s goal (e.g., Inform about a schedule).
- **Social**: Managing interaction (e.g., Greet, Thank).

**Example**:

- Utterance: “Can you book a table?”
- Dialogue Act: Request (forward-looking, task-related).

### 2.3 Why Use Dialogue Acts?

Dialogue acts provide a structured way to:

- Understand user intent.
- Generate relevant responses.
- Maintain conversational coherence.

**Real-World Example**: A travel chatbot responds to “What’s my flight status?” with “Your flight is on time, departing at 5 PM,” using the Inform dialogue act.

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Identify the Dialogue Act

The system uses **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)** to analyze the user’s input and determine the dialogue act, often considering context from prior conversation.

**Example**:

- Input: “What’s the weather like?”
- Dialogue Act: Request, Content = {Weather}.

### Step 2: Content Planning

Select the information to convey based on the dialogue act and context, often by querying a database or knowledge base.

**Example**:

- Dialogue Act: Inform
- Content: {Weather: Sunny, Temperature: 25°C}
- Plan: Share weather and temperature.

### Step 3: Sentence Planning

Decide how to structure the response, considering:

- **Tone**: Formal, informal, polite.
- **Structure**: Simple or complex sentences.
- **Lexical Choices**: Words suited to the context.

**Example**:

- Formal: “The weather is sunny with a temperature of 25°C.”
- Informal: “It’s sunny out there, 25°C!”

### Step 4: Surface Realization

Generate the final text using:

- **Templates**: Predefined sentence structures.
- **Rule-Based Systems**: Logic-driven text generation.
- **Neural Models**: Advanced models like GPT for dynamic text.

**Example**:

- Template: “The weather is [Condition] with a temperature of [Temp].”
- Output: “The weather is sunny with a temperature of 25°C.”

## 4. Mathematical Foundations

Dialogue act-based NLG often uses probabilistic models to classify dialogue acts or select responses. Let’s explore a **Naive Bayes classifier** for dialogue act identification.

### 4.1 Probabilistic Dialogue Act Classification

We can use a probabilistic approach (Naive Bayes) to classify dialogue acts. The formula is:

$$
P(\text{DA} \mid U) = \frac{P(U \mid \text{DA}) \cdot P(\text{DA})}{P(U)}
$$

Where:

- **DA**: Dialogue Act (e.g., Request, Inform)
- **U**: User utterance
- **$P(\text{DA} \mid U)$**: Probability of the dialogue act given the utterance
- **$P(U \mid \text{DA})$**: Likelihood of the utterance given the dialogue act
- **$P(\text{DA})$**: Prior probability of the dialogue act
- **$P(U)$**: Probability of the utterance (normalizing constant)

**Example Calculation**

Suppose the user says:  
_Utterance_: “What’s the time?”  
Possible Dialogue Acts: **Request**, **Inform**

From training data, we have:

- **Priors**:
  - $P(\text{Request}) = 0.6$
  - $P(\text{Inform}) = 0.4$
- **Likelihoods** (for words "what" and "time"):
  - $P(\text{“what”} \mid \text{Request}) = 0.8$
  - $P(\text{“time”} \mid \text{Request}) = 0.7$
  - $P(\text{“what”} \mid \text{Inform}) = 0.2$
  - $P(\text{“time”} \mid \text{Inform}) = 0.3$

Calculate the likelihoods for the utterance:

- $P(U \mid \text{Request}) = 0.8 \times 0.7 = 0.56$
- $P(U \mid \text{Inform}) = 0.2 \times 0.3 = 0.06$

Calculate the (unnormalized) posteriors:

- $P(\text{Request} \mid U) \propto 0.56 \times 0.6 = 0.336$
- $P(\text{Inform} \mid U) \propto 0.06 \times 0.4 = 0.024$

**Conclusion**:  
Since $0.336 > 0.024$, the predicted Dialogue Act is **Request**.
To visualize the frequency of dialogue acts in a conversation, we can create a bar chart. Suppose we analyze a chatbot’s logs and find the following distribution:

- Request: 50%
- Inform: 30%
- Greet: 15%
- Confirm: 5%

```chartjs
{
  "type": "bar",
  "data": {
    "labels": ["Request", "Inform", "Greet", "Confirm"],
    "datasets": [{
      "label": "Dialogue Act Distribution",
      "data": [50, 30, 15, 5],
      "backgroundColor": ["#36A2EB", "#FF6384", "#FFCE56", "#4BC0C0"],
      "borderColor": ["#2A80B9", "#CC4B37", "#D4A017", "#3A9A9A"],
      "borderWidth": 1
    }]
  },
  "options": {
    "scales": {
      "y": {
        "beginAtZero": true,
        "title": {
          "display": true,
          "text": "Percentage (%)"
        }
      },
      "x": {
        "title": {
          "display": true,
          "text": "Dialogue Act"
        }
      }
    },
    "plugins": {
      "legend": {
        "display": false
      },
      "title": {
        "display": true,
        "text": "Dialogue Act Distribution in a Chatbot"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Copy this chart into your notes as a bar graph with labeled axes and colors for each dialogue act.

## 7. Complete Example with Calculation

### Scenario

- **Input**: “Can you reserve a table for 4 at 7 PM?”
- **Goal**: Generate a confirmation response for a restaurant chatbot.

### Step-by-Step

1. **Identify Dialogue Act**:

   - Utterance: “Can you reserve a table for 4 at 7 PM?”
   - Features: “can,” “reserve,” “table,” “4,” “7 PM.”
   - Naive Bayes Calculation:
     - Priors: $$ P(\text{Request}) = 0.7,\quad P(\text{Inform}) = 0.3 $$
     - Likelihoods:
       - $$ P(U \mid \text{Request}) = 0.9 \times 0.8 \times 0.7 = 0.504 $$
       - $$ P(U \mid \text{Inform}) = 0.2 \times 0.3 \times 0.2 = 0.012 $$
     - Posteriors:
       - $$ P(\text{Request} \mid U) \propto 0.504 \times 0.7 = 0.3528 $$
       - $$ P(\text{Inform} \mid U) \propto 0.012 \times 0.3 = 0.0036 $$
     - Result: Dialogue Act = Request, Content = {BookTable, PartySize: 4, Time: 7 PM}.

2. **Content Planning**:

   - Query reservation system: Table available for 4 at 7 PM.
   - Content: {Confirmation: True, PartySize: 4, Time: 7 PM, Restaurant: Bella Vita}.

3. **Sentence Planning**:

   - Tone: Polite, professional.
   - Structure: Confirm details with restaurant name.

4. **Surface Realization**:
   - Template: “Your table for [PartySize] at [Time] is confirmed at [Restaurant].”
   - Output: “Your table for 4 at 7 PM is confirmed at Bella Vita.”

## Additional Details (Enhancements)

Since you’re relying solely on this tutorial, here are extra details to ensure you have a robust understanding:

### 11.1 Advanced Techniques

- **Neural NLG**: Modern systems use transformer models (e.g., GPT, T5) for surface realization, allowing dynamic and context-aware text generation. For example, a neural model might generate varied responses like “Your table’s booked!” or “Reservation confirmed!” based on training data.
- **Context Modeling**: Advanced systems track conversation history using dialogue state trackers to ensure coherence across multiple turns.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **BLEU**: Measures text similarity between generated and reference responses.
  - **Human Evaluation**: Assesses fluency, coherence, and appropriateness via user feedback.

### 11.2 Coding Example

Here’s a simple Python template-based NLG system to get you started:

```python
def generate_response(dialogue_act, content):
    templates = {
        "Inform": "The {key} is {value}.",
        "Request": "Please provide the {key}.",
        "Confirm": "Your {key} for {value} is confirmed."
    }
    template = templates.get(dialogue_act, "Sorry, I don’t understand.")
    return template.format(**content)

# Example
content = {"key": "meeting time", "value": "2 PM"}
print(generate_response("Inform", content))  # Output: The meeting time is 2 PM.
```

**Note**: Copy this code into your notes and try modifying it to handle different dialogue acts.

### 11.3 Research Challenges

- **Ambiguity**: Users may express intents unclearly (e.g., “What about tomorrow?”). Research focuses on robust NLU to handle such cases.
- **Multilinguality**: Extending dialogue act-based NLG to multiple languages is an active research area.
- **Personalization**: Tailoring responses to user preferences (e.g., formal vs. casual) is a growing field.
