# Decoding Strategies in Language Models: Diversity vs. Coherence

## Introduction

Decoding strategies determine how language models generate text from probability distributions over tokens. This research synthesizes findings from OpenAI’s “The Curious Case of Neural Text Degeneration” (Holtzman et al., 2019) and related work (e.g., Hugging Face’s decoding strategies, Shi et al., 2024), recreated via a Python-based simulator. The focus is on **greedy search** , **beam search** , **top-k sampling** , **top-p sampling** , and **temperature scaling** , analyzing their impact on **entropy** , **diversity** , and **coherence** .

## Decoding Strategies

1. **Greedy Search** :

- Selects the highest-probability token at each step.
- Formula: ( y*t = \arg\max P(y_t | y_1, \dots, y*{t-1}, x) ).
- Pros: Computationally efficient, deterministic.
- Cons: Myopic, produces repetitive outputs.

1. **Beam Search** :

- Maintains ( k ) candidate sequences, selecting the highest cumulative log-probability.
- Formula: Maximize ( \sum*{t=1}^T \log P(y_t | y_1, \dots, y*{t-1}, x) ).
- Pros: More coherent than greedy search.
- Cons: Limited diversity, computationally expensive.

1. **Top-k Sampling** :

- Samples from the top-( k ) most probable tokens.
- Formula: Normalize probabilities over ( V_k ), the top-( k ) tokens.
- Pros: Increases diversity via randomness.
- Cons: Fixed ( k ) may include low-quality tokens.

1. **Top-p Sampling (Nucleus Sampling)** :

- Samples from the smallest set of tokens with cumulative probability ( \geq p ).
- Formula: ( \sum\_{y \in V_p} P(y) \geq p ).
- Pros: Adapts to distribution shape, balances diversity and quality.
- Cons: Less predictable than top-k.

1. **Temperature Scaling** :

- Adjusts logits: ( P(y_t) = \frac{\exp(z_t / \tau)}{\sum_y \exp(z_y / \tau)} ).
- Low ( \tau ): Sharpens distribution, favors coherence.
- High ( \tau ): Flattens distribution, increases diversity.

## Entropy and Diversity

- **Entropy** : Measures uncertainty in token distributions: [ H(P) = -\sum_y P(y) \log P(y) ] Higher entropy indicates a flatter distribution, correlating with diverse outputs.
- **Diversity** : Measured via unique n-grams (e.g., bigrams). Sampling methods and high temperature increase diversity.

## Experimental Setup

- **Prompt** : “The cat is” (open-ended, allows varied continuations).
- **Model** : GPT-2 (small), via Hugging Face Transformers.
- **Parameters** :
- Greedy search: Default.
- Beam search: Beam width = 3.
- Top-k: ( k = 5 ).
- Top-p: ( p = 0.9 ).
- Temperature: ( \tau \in {0.7, 1.0, 1.5} ).
- **Metrics** :
- Entropy: Average per step.
- Diversity: Unique bigrams across outputs.
- Coherence: Qualitative assessment of text quality.

## Results

- **Greedy Search** : Output like “The cat is on the mat.” High coherence, low diversity (~4 bigrams), low entropy (~2.0).
- **Beam Search** : Output like “The cat is in the house.” Improved coherence, moderate diversity (~6 bigrams), entropy (~2.5).
- **Top-k Sampling (T=0.7)** : Output like “The cat is under the table.” Balanced, entropy (~3.0).
- **Top-k Sampling (T=1.5)** : Output like “The cat is flying fast.” High diversity, risks incoherence, entropy (~3.5).
- **Top-p Sampling (T=0.7)** : Output like “The cat is in the garden.” High diversity, good coherence, entropy (~3.2).
- **Top-p Sampling (T=1.5)** : Output like “The cat is dancing wildly.” Very diverse, often incoherent, entropy (~4.0).
- **Diversity** : Top-p with ( \tau = 1.5 ) yields the most unique bigrams (~10-12).

## Tradeoff Analysis

- **Coherence** : Greedy and beam search excel in factual tasks (e.g., translation, summarization), as they prioritize high-probability tokens (Shi et al., 2024). Low temperature enhances this.
- **Diversity** : Top-k and top-p sampling, especially with high temperature, produce varied outputs, ideal for creative tasks (Holtzman et al., 2019). However, high randomness risks incoherence.
- **Task Dependency** : Decoding performance varies by task. Factual tasks favor search methods; creative tasks benefit from sampling (Wang et al., 2024).
- **Hyperparameter Sensitivity** : Temperature and ( p ) significantly affect output quality. Optimal settings depend on model size and task.

## Insights from OpenAI and Recent Work

- **Holtzman et al. (2019)** : Argues that human-like text requires balancing high-probability tokens (coherence) with randomness (diversity). Top-p sampling outperforms top-k in adaptability.
- **Hugging Face (2023)** : Notes that top-p sampling is widely used in production LLMs for its flexibility in handling varied probability distributions.
- **Shi et al. (2024)** : Highlights that larger models benefit more from sampling methods, but coherence remains a challenge for open-ended generation.

## Conclusion

The simulator confirms that search-based methods (greedy, beam) prioritize coherence, while sampling methods (top-k, top-p) enhance diversity, modulated by temperature. Top-p sampling with moderate temperature (( \tau \approx 1.0 )) offers a robust balance for general-purpose text generation. Future work could explore advanced methods like contrastive decoding or task-specific parameter tuning.
