# A Comprehensive Beginner's Tutorial on Greedy and Beam Search in Natural Language Generation (NLG)

Welcome, aspiring scientist and researcher! This tutorial will guide you step by step through the foundational concepts of Greedy and Beam Search in Natural Language Generation (NLG). We'll use clear explanations, analogies, real-world examples, and—where appropriate—mathematical formulations in proper display math format. By the end, you'll have a solid foundation for research and innovation in AI and computational linguistics.

## Section 1: Introduction to Natural Language Generation (NLG)

Before we dive into decoding strategies, let's understand the big picture.

### 1.1 What is NLG?

- **Definition:** NLG is the process of teaching computers to generate human-like text from structured data or model outputs.
- **Analogy:** Think of NLG as a chef (the computer) using ingredients (data) and a recipe (the model) to create a meal (coherent text). Without NLG, you just get a list of ingredients, not a meal.
- **Examples:**
  - Chatbots (e.g., Siri, Grok) generating responses.
  - Weather apps turning data into sentences: "It's a sunny day with temperatures reaching 75°F."
  - Medical and scientific report generation.
- **Why It Matters:** NLG powers tools for data analysis, hypothesis generation, and even automated scientific writing.

### 1.2 Key Components of NLG Systems

- **Input:** Structured data or a prompt (e.g., "Translate 'Hello' to French").
- **Output:** A sequence of tokens (words or subwords).
- **The Challenge:** The model predicts one token at a time, not the whole sentence at once.
- **Decoding:** The process of selecting the best sequence from the model's probability predictions.

**Visualization to Sketch:**  
Draw a flowchart:  
Input Prompt → Model Predicts Probabilities → Decoder Selects Token → Repeat → Output Sentence.

**Key Takeaway:**  
NLG turns data into language, but decoding ensures the output is coherent and meaningful.

## Section 2: Understanding Decoding in NLG

Decoding is central to sequence generation. At each step, models like RNNs or Transformers output a probability distribution over possible next tokens.

### 2.1 Why Do We Need Search Strategies?

- **The Problem:** The number of possible sentences grows exponentially with length. For a vocabulary of 10,000 words and a 10-word sentence, there are \( 10{,}000^{10} \) possibilities!
- **Mathematical Formulation:**

  The probability of a sequence is:

  $$
  P(\text{sequence}) = P(w_1) \cdot P(w_2|w_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot P(w_N|w_1, \ldots, w_{N-1})
  $$

  For numerical stability, we use log probabilities:

  $$
  \log P(\text{sequence}) = \sum_{i=1}^N \log P(w_i | w_1, \ldots, w_{i-1})
  $$

- **Analogy:** Decoding is like navigating a maze, making choices step by step to find the best path.
- **Types of Strategies:** Exhaustive search is impossible, so we use approximations like Greedy (fast, shortsighted) and Beam (balances exploration).

**Real-World Case:**  
In machine translation, poor decoding can turn "The cat sat on the mat" into "The cat sat on the hat" if the wrong word is chosen early.

**Key Takeaway:**  
Decoding efficiently approximates the best sequence.

## Section 3: Greedy Search in NLG

Greedy Search is the simplest decoding strategy: always pick the most probable next token at each step.

### 3.1 Theory Behind Greedy Search

- **How It Works:**

  1. Start with the input prompt.
  2. At each step, predict probabilities for the next token.
  3. Select the token with the highest probability (argmax).
  4. Repeat until an end token (e.g., "<EOS>") or max length.

- **Pros:** Fast (\( O(T \times V) \)), simple.
- **Cons:** Shortsighted, can miss better sequences, may produce repetitive or suboptimal text.
- **When to Use:** Quick prototypes, real-time chat.

**Analogy:**  
Like always picking the tastiest visible bite at a buffet—may miss a better overall meal.

### 3.2 Mathematical Explanation and Example Calculation

Suppose our vocabulary is { "The", "cat", "sat", "on", "mat", "hat", "<EOS>" }.

- **Scenario:** Generate a sentence starting with "The cat".
- **Model Probabilities:**

  - Step 1 (after "The cat"):

    $$
    P(\text{sat}) = 0.6,\quad P(\text{on}) = 0.3,\quad P(\text{hat}) = 0.1
    $$

    Greedy picks "sat" (\(0.6\)).

  - Step 2 (after "The cat sat"):

    $$
    P(\text{on}) = 0.7,\quad P(\text{mat}) = 0.2,\quad P(\text{<EOS>}) = 0.1
    $$

    Picks "on" (\(0.7\)).

  - Step 3 (after "The cat sat on"):

    $$
    P(\text{mat}) = 0.8,\quad P(\text{hat}) = 0.1,\quad P(\text{<EOS>}) = 0.1
    $$

    Picks "mat" (\(0.8\)).

  - Step 4: Hits <EOS>.

- **Full Calculation:**

  The sequence is: "The cat sat on the mat <EOS>"

  The log probability is:

  $$
  \log(1.0) + \log(0.6) + \log(0.7) + \log(0.8) + \log(1.0) \approx 0 + (-0.5108) + (-0.3567) + (-0.2231) + 0 = -1.0906
  $$

  A better sequence might exist (e.g., "The cat sat on the hat") if later steps have higher probabilities, but Greedy misses it.

- **General Equation:**

  At each step \( t \):

  $$
  \text{next\_token} = \underset{w \in V}{\arg\max} \; P(w \mid \text{sequence}_{1:t-1})
  $$

### 3.3 Example

- **Prompt:** "Translate 'Bonjour' to English."
- **Greedy Output:** Model predicts "Hello" (\(0.9\)), "Hi" (\(0.05\)), etc. Greedy picks "Hello".
- **Issue:** If \( P(\text{"good"}) = 0.4 \), \( P(\text{"great"}) = 0.3 \), but "great day" is better overall, Greedy still picks "good" and may get "good morning" (lower total probability).

### 3.4 Real-World Cases

- **Chatbots:** Early Siri used greedy search, leading to repetitive or bland replies.
- **Research:** Greedy is used for quick summaries or as a baseline.
- **For Scientists:** Use greedy to benchmark your models.

**Visualization to Sketch:**  
Draw a tree with the root "The cat" and thick branches for high-probability choices. Greedy follows the thickest branch at each step.

**Key Takeaway:**  
Greedy is efficient but can be risky—good for starting, but better methods exist.

## Section 4: Beam Search in NLG

Beam Search improves on Greedy by keeping multiple candidate sequences at each step.

### 4.1 Theory Behind Beam Search

- **How It Works:**

  1. Set beam width \( K \) (number of sequences to track).
  2. For each current sequence, predict next tokens and their probabilities.
  3. Generate all possible extensions (\( K \times V \) candidates).
  4. Select the top \( K \) sequences by total probability.
  5. Repeat until end.

- **Pros:** Higher quality, explores alternatives, avoids local optima.
- **Cons:** Slower (\( O(K \times T \times V \log(KV)) \)), may still miss global best if \( K \) is small.
- **When to Use:** High-quality NLG tasks (translation, story generation).

**Analogy:**  
Like hiking with \( K \) friends, each exploring a promising trail. At each fork, you keep the best \( K \) paths.

### 4.2 Mathematical Explanation and Example Calculation

Suppose the same vocabulary and start ("The cat"), with beam width \( K = 2 \):

- **Step 1:**

  $$
  \text{Candidates:} \quad \text{"sat"}\ (0.6),\ \text{"on"}\ (0.3)
  $$

  Top 2: "sat", "on".

- **Step 2 (extend each):**

  - From "sat":
    $$
    \text{"sat on"}: 0.6 \times 0.7 = 0.42 \\
    \text{"sat mat"}: 0.6 \times 0.2 = 0.12
    $$
  - From "on":
    $$
    \text{"on mat"}: 0.3 \times 0.8 = 0.24 \\
    \text{"on hat"}: 0.3 \times 0.1 = 0.03
    $$
  - All candidates: 0.42, 0.24, 0.12, 0.03. Top 2: "sat on" (0.42), "on mat" (0.24).

- **Step 3 (extend top 2):**

  - From "sat on":
    $$
    \text{"sat on mat"}: 0.42 \times 0.8 = 0.336 \\
    \text{"sat on hat"}: 0.42 \times 0.1 = 0.042
    $$
  - From "on mat":
    $$
    \text{"on mat <EOS>"}: 0.24 \times 0.9 = 0.216
    $$
  - Top 2: "sat on mat" (0.336), "on mat <EOS>" (0.216).

- **Final:**  
  Pick the highest: "The cat sat on mat" with

  $$
  \log(0.336) \approx -1.090
  $$

- **General Equation:**

  At step \( t \):

  $$
  \text{score}(\text{sequence}) = \sum_{i=1}^t \log P(w_i \mid w_1, \ldots, w_{i-1})
  $$

  Keep the top \( K \) sequences by score.

### 4.3 Example

- **Prompt:** "Write a story about a cat."
- **Beam Output (\( K=3 \))**: Explores "The cat jumped...", "The cat slept...", "The cat ate..." and picks the most coherent.
- **Comparison:** Greedy might get stuck in repetition if probabilities glitch.

### 4.4 Real-World Cases

- **Machine Translation:** Beam search ensures more accurate, coherent translations.
- **Medical NLG:** Generates patient reports, exploring options to avoid errors.
- **Research:** Used in advanced models (e.g., BERT) for generation. Researchers tune \( K \) for optimal results.

**Visualization to Sketch:**  
Draw a tree with \( K=2 \):  
Root "The cat", two branches ("sat", "on"), each splits, prune to top 2 at each step.

**Key Takeaway:**  
Beam search balances speed and quality—essential for rigorous research.

## Section 5: Comparing Greedy and Beam Search

| Aspect     | Greedy Search           | Beam Search                |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Speed      | Very fast (single path) | Slower (multiple paths)    |
| Quality    | Often suboptimal        | Better, more coherent      |
| Complexity | Simple                  | More complex, needs tuning |
| Use Case   | Quick drafts            | Polished outputs           |
| Math Focus | Argmax per step         | Top-K cumulative probs     |

- **When to Choose:** Start with greedy for baselines, upgrade to beam for production. In research, experiment with hybrids (e.g., diverse beam).

**Real-World Insight:**  
In Tesla's AI for self-driving cars, similar search strategies are used: greedy for real-time, beam for planning.

---

## Section 6: Advanced Tips for Researchers

- **Extensions:** Try nucleus sampling or temperature scaling for more creative outputs.
- **Implementation:** In Python (e.g., Hugging Face), greedy is a loop with `torch.argmax`; beam uses built-in `beam_search`.
- **Career Path:** Practice on datasets like WMT for translation. Publish findings on how beam improves scientific NLG.
