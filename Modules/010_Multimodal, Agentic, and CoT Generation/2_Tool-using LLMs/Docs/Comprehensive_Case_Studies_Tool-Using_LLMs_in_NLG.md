# Comprehensive Case Studies: Tool-Using Large Language Models in Natural Language Generation

## Preamble

As a scientist, researcher, professor, engineer, mathematician, drawing inspiration from Alan Turing's computational theories, Albert Einstein's relativistic insights, and Nikola Tesla's inventive engineering, I present this expanded compilation of case studies on tool-using (agentic) Large Language Models (LLMs) in Natural Language Generation (NLG). This document synthesizes historical and 2025-specific examples, emphasizing how LLMs integrate external tools—such as APIs, calculators, databases, or reasoning frameworks—to enhance NLG accuracy, context-awareness, and utility. Like Turing's universal machine extending computation, these case studies illustrate LLMs as extensible systems for real-world problem-solving. References are cited inline where applicable, drawn from recent sources as of September 20, 2025.

## Introduction to Tool-Using LLMs in NLG

Tool-using LLMs, often termed "agentic AI," employ multi-step reasoning, action-taking, and interaction via external tools to generate natural language outputs. This augments traditional NLG by mitigating hallucinations and incorporating real-time data. Key frameworks include ReAct (Reason + Act) and agentic architectures like those in LangChain. In 2025, advancements focus on multimodal integration and ethical deployment <grok:render card_id="52dc6a" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
