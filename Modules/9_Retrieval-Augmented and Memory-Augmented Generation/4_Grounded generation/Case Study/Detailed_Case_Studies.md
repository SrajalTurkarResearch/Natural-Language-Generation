## Case Study 1: Medical Report Generation for Accurate Diagnoses (Healthcare)

### Context

Hospitals handle massive patient data, like blood tests or heart rates, stored in electronic health records (EHRs). Doctors need clear summaries, but ungrounded NLG can invent wrong details (e.g., "Patient is healthy" when tests show issues). This can delay treatments or harm patients, especially in critical fields like oncology.

### How Grounded NLG Helps

Grounded NLG uses EHRs as a "truth anchor" to generate accurate reports. For example:

- **Input** : EHR data (`BP=120/80, heart_rate=70, hemoglobin=12g/dL`).
- **Output** : "Patient has normal blood pressure (120/80), heart rate (70 bpm), and mild anemia (hemoglobin 12g/dL)."
- **Link to Tutorial** : See `code_guides.py` (template NLG) for a similar idea, or `major_project.py` for a Q&A system adaptable to medical queries.

### Methodology

- **Technique** : Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The system:

1. Queries EHR database (e.g., SQL table of patient metrics).
2. Retrieves relevant records using vector similarity (like `cosine_similarity` in `code_guides.py`).
3. Generates text with a model like DistilGPT-2, ensuring output matches records.

- **Example Workflow** : For a query "Summarize patient X’s status," RAG pulls exact metrics and writes a concise report.
- **Math Connection** : Faithfulness score = (matching tokens / total tokens). See `theory.py` (#4) for details.

### Real-World Impact (2025)

- A 2025 Nature Medicine study found grounded NLG reduced report errors by 25% compared to ungrounded models, improving diagnosis speed for conditions like gliomas.
- Hospitals adopted grounded systems for real-time summaries, aiding overworked staff.
- **Analogy** : Like a lab technician double-checking test results before reporting to a doctor.

### Research Prompt

- **Experiment Idea** : Adapt `major_project.py` to ground in a mock EHR dataset (e.g., Kaggle’s synthetic patient data). Test if RAG reduces errors for rare diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis). Metric: FactScore (overlap of output with EHR facts).
- **Question** : Can grounding improve trust in AI diagnostics for understudied conditions?

## Case Study 2: Climate Data Summaries for Policy Reports (Environmental Science)

### Context

Climate scientists analyze huge datasets from satellites or sensors (e.g., temperature anomalies, CO2 levels). Manual summaries are slow, and ungrounded NLG risks misreporting trends, misleading policymakers or the public.

### How Grounded NLG Helps

Grounded NLG uses raw data as the source, ensuring accurate, timely reports. For example:

- **Input** : Data (`temp_anomaly=+1.2°C, region=Arctic, date=2025-01`).
- **Output** : "Arctic temperatures rose 1.2°C above average in January 2025, signaling accelerated warming."
- **Link to Tutorial** : See `mini_project.py` (weather report) for a simple version, or extend `major_project.py` for data-driven Q&A.

### Methodology

- **Technique** : Data-grounded NLG with table parsing.

1. Parse structured data (e.g., CSV with columns: region, temp, date).
2. Select relevant rows (e.g., filter by region=Arctic).
3. Generate text using templates or small models, constrained to data values.

- **Example Workflow** : Query "Arctic climate trend?" retrieves data points, generates a summary.
- **Math Connection** : Relevance score = cosine similarity between query and data embeddings. See `code_guides.py` (RAG section).

### Real-World Impact (2025)

- Grounded NLG powered IPCC 2025 reports, summarizing petabytes of satellite data into clear briefs for global leaders.
- Accuracy improved public trust, with 90% alignment to raw data (per Nature Climate Change, 2025).
- **Analogy** : Like a weather forecaster using radar data, not guesses, to predict storms.

### Research Prompt

- **Experiment Idea** : Use `mini_project.py` as a base. Add a dataset (e.g., NOAA climate data from Kaggle). Test if grounding improves summary accuracy for local climate impacts (e.g., city-level flooding risks). Metric: BLEU score (text overlap with human summaries).
- **Question** : Can grounded NLG predict regional climate impacts faster than humans?

## Case Study 3: Persuasive AI for Science Outreach (Education)

### Context

Scientists struggle to share discoveries with the public, who may find raw facts boring. Ungrounded NLG can exaggerate (e.g., "This drug cures all cancers"), eroding trust. Grounded persuasive NLG combines truth with engaging language.

### How Grounded NLG Helps

It grounds in verified facts but crafts appealing narratives. For example:

- **Input** : Fact ("Solar panels 30% more efficient in 2025").
- **Output** : "New solar panels are 30% stronger, powering homes greener and cheaper!"
- **Link to Tutorial** : See `code_guides.py` (advanced section) for grounding with a model, adaptable to persuasive prompts.

### Methodology

- **Technique** : Agentic system with three parts:

1. Fact-Finder: Retrieves verified data (e.g., solar efficiency stats).
2. Persuasion Module: Adds engaging words (e.g., "greener, cheaper").
3. Generator: Combines into fluent text, checked for truth.

- **Example Workflow** : Query "Explain solar advances" pulls efficiency data, adds persuasive tone, and outputs a blog-style text.
- **Math Connection** : Balance truth (faithfulness score) and appeal (sentiment score via VADER). See `theory.py` (#5).

### Real-World Impact (2025)

- An arXiv paper (Feb 2025) showed grounded persuasive AI increased public engagement by 70% in science blogs, with 90% fact accuracy.
- Museums used it for interactive exhibits, explaining complex topics like quantum physics.
- **Analogy** : Like a teacher making science fun but sticking to the textbook.

### Research Prompt

- **Experiment Idea** : Modify `code_guides.py` (advanced section) to generate persuasive science tweets grounded in facts (e.g., arXiv dataset). Test engagement (e.g., simulate likes). Metric: Sentiment score vs. faithfulness.
- **Question** : How do you balance truth and appeal without misleading?

## Case Study 4: Fact-Checked News Summaries (Journalism)

### Context

Newsrooms need quick, accurate summaries of events, but ungrounded AI can spread fake news (e.g., wrong election results). This erodes public trust and harms democratic processes.

### How Grounded NLG Helps

Grounded NLG uses verified sources (e.g., official reports, APIs) to summarize news. For example:

- **Input** : Report ("2024 election: Candidate X won 52% in state Y").
- **Output** : "Candidate X won the 2024 election in state Y with 52% of votes."
- **Link to Tutorial** : See `major_project.py` for a Q&A system, adaptable to news queries.

### Methodology

- **Technique** : Document-grounded NLG.

1. Retrieve full documents (e.g., official PDFs) or snippets via RAG.
2. Use a model to summarize, constrained to source text.
3. Verify with entailment checks (facts support output).

- **Example Workflow** : Query "Election results?" pulls official data, generates a summary.
- **Math Connection** : Entailment score = P(facts entail output). See `theory.py` (#4).

### Real-World Impact (2025)

- Tools like Perplexity.ai (2025) used grounded NLG for real-time news, reducing misinformation by 40% (per Journalism Studies, 2025).
- Newsrooms saved 30% reporting time, focusing on analysis.
- **Analogy** : Like a journalist citing primary sources, not rumors.

### Research Prompt

- **Experiment Idea** : Extend `major_project.py` with a mock news dataset (e.g., BBC archives). Test if grounding reduces fake news spread. Metric: Hallucination rate (false tokens / total).
- **Question** : Can grounded NLG scale to live news feeds without bias?
