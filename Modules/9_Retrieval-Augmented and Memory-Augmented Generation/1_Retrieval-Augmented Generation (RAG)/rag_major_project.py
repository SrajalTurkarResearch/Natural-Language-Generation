"""
rag_major_project.py - Major project for RAG in climate research.

Purpose: Build a RAG system to query climate-related documents, simulating a scientific
application for summarizing research findings.

For Researchers: This is your chance to apply RAG to a real-world domain, like Einstein
synthesizing climate data into actionable insights.
