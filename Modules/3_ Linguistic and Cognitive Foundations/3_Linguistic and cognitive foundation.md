## 1. Grammar: Dependency and Constituency

Grammar is the blueprint for constructing sentences. It defines how words combine to convey meaning. We’ll explore two complementary approaches: **Dependency Grammar** (focusing on word-to-word relationships) and **Constituency Grammar** (focusing on phrase structures).

### 1.1 Dependency Grammar

#### Theory

Dependency grammar analyzes a sentence as a network of word-to-word relationships, where each word depends on another (its “head”). The verb is typically the root, and other words (nouns, adjectives, etc.) are connected via dependency relations, forming a tree-like structure. This approach emphasizes the functional relationships between words, regardless of their order.

- **Analogy**: Picture a sentence as a solar system. The verb is the sun (root), and other words (planets) orbit it or each other, connected by gravitational pulls (dependencies). The arrangement of planets doesn’t matter as long as their orbits (relations) are clear.
- **Key Terms**:
  - **Head**: The word that governs another (e.g., the verb “chased” in “The dog chased”).
  - **Dependent**: The word relying on the head (e.g., “dog” as the subject).
  - **Dependency Relation**: The type of connection, like subject (nsubj), object (dobj), or determiner (det).
- **Why It’s Useful**: Dependency grammar is flexible, making it ideal for languages with free word order (e.g., Russian, where “Dog the cat chased” is valid).

#### Example

Sentence: “The quick dog chased the small cat.”

- **Root**: “chased” (the verb).
- **Dependencies**:
  - “The” → “dog” (det: determiner).
  - “quick” → “dog” (amod: adjectival modifier).
  - “dog” → “chased” (nsubj: nominal subject).
  - “the” → “cat” (det: determiner).
  - “small” → “cat” (amod: adjectival modifier).
  - “cat” → “chased” (dobj: direct object).

#### Visualization

Here’s the dependency tree:

```
          chased
         /   |   \
       dog  |    cat
      /  \  |   /  \
    The quick the small
```

#### Real-World Case

Dependency grammar is foundational in **NLP for machine translation**. For example, in Google Translate, the sentence “The quick dog chased the small cat” is parsed into a dependency tree to translate into Spanish: “El perro rápido persiguió al gato pequeño.” The tree ensures that “dog” remains the subject and “cat” the object, preserving meaning despite word order differences. This is critical for languages like Japanese, where word order is flexible but dependencies remain consistent.

#### Additional Example

Sentence: “Mary quietly read a book.”

- **Root**: “read”.
- **Dependencies**:
  - “Mary” → “read” (nsubj).
  - “quietly” → “read” (advmod: adverbial modifier).
  - “a” → “book” (det).
  - “book” → “read” (dobj).
- **Tree**:

```
         read
       /  |   \
    Mary quietly book
                /
               a
```

#### Math

Dependency parsing models a sentence as a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**:

- **Nodes**: Words.
- **Edges**: Dependency relations.
- **Constraint**: Each word (except the root) has exactly one head.
- For a sentence with \( n \) words, the tree has \( n - 1 \) edges.

**Calculation Example**:

- Sentence: “The quick dog chased the small cat” (6 words).
- Nodes: {The, quick, dog, chased, the, small, cat}.
- Edges: {(The → dog), (quick → dog), (dog → chased), (the → cat), (small → cat), (cat → chased)}.
- Total edges = $$6 - 1 = 5$$.

**Parsing Complexity**: The number of possible dependency trees for \( n \) words is given by the Cayley’s formula for labeled trees: \( n^{n-2} \). For 6 words, there are \( 6^{6-2} = 6^4 = 1296 \) possible trees, but constraints (e.g., verbs as roots) reduce this number.

#### Logic for Researchers

Dependency grammar is powerful for capturing syntactic relationships in a compact way. It’s computationally efficient for parsing and widely used in tools like spaCy or Stanford NLP. As a researcher, you can explore dependency-based models for tasks like sentiment analysis or question answering, where word relationships are key.

### 1.2 Constituency Grammar

#### Theory

Constituency grammar breaks a sentence into nested phrases (constituents), such as noun phrases (NP) or verb phrases (VP). Each phrase acts as a unit, and the sentence is represented as a tree where nodes are phrases and leaves are words. This approach emphasizes hierarchical structure.

- **Analogy**: Think of a sentence as a family tree. The sentence (S) is the ancestor, branching into children (NP, VP), which may have their own children (e.g., Det, N), down to the leaves (words).
- **Key Terms**:
  - **Constituent**: A phrase like NP (“the dog”) or VP (“chased the cat”).
  - **Phrase Structure Rules**: Rules defining how phrases combine, e.g., \( S \rightarrow NP VP \), \( NP \rightarrow Det Adj N \).
  - **Terminal**: Words at the leaves.
  - **Non-terminal**: Phrases like NP, VP, S.
- **Why It’s Useful**: Constituency grammar suits languages with strict word order (e.g., English), where phrases follow predictable patterns.

#### Example

Sentence: “The quick dog chased the small cat.”

- **Constituents**:
  - Sentence (S): The entire sentence.
  - Noun Phrase (NP): “The quick dog”, “the small cat”.
  - Verb Phrase (VP): “chased the small cat”.
- **Tree**:

```
           S
         /   \
        NP   VP
       /|\   / \
      Det Adj N V  NP
      |   |   | |  /|\
     The quick dog chased Det Adj N
                         |   |   |
                        the small cat
```

#### Real-World Case

Constituency grammar is used in **grammar checkers** like Grammarly or Microsoft Word. For example, the sentence “Quick dog chased small cat” might be flagged for missing determiners (“the”), as the NP rule (\( NP \rightarrow Det Adj N \)) expects a determiner in English. This ensures sentences follow standard phrase structures.

#### Additional Example

Sentence: “Mary quietly read a book.”

- **Constituents**:
  - S: The sentence.
  - NP: “Mary”.
  - VP: “quietly read a book”.
  - NP: “a book”.
- **Tree**:

```
         S
        / \
       NP VP
       |  /|\
       N Adv V NP
       |  |  | / \
      Mary quietly read Det N
                       |   |
                       a  book
```

#### Visualization

See the trees above, showing how phrases nest hierarchically.

#### Math

Constituency grammar uses **context-free grammars (CFGs)**:

- **Terminals**: Words (e.g., “dog”, “chased”).
- **Non-terminals**: Phrases (e.g., NP, VP).
- **Rules**: \( S \rightarrow NP\ VP \), \( NP \rightarrow Det\ Adj\ N \), \( VP \rightarrow Adv\ V\ NP \).
- **Tree Size**: For \( n \) words, the tree has approximately
  $$
  2n - 1
  $$
  nodes (words + phrases).

**Calculation Example**:

- Sentence: “The quick dog chased the small cat” (6 words).
- Nodes:
  - Terminals: The, quick, dog, chased, the, small, cat (7 nodes, including two “the”).
  - Non-terminals: S, NP, VP, NP (4 nodes).
- Total nodes: $$2 \times 6 - 1 = 11$$

**Parsing Complexity**: The number of possible parse trees is exponential, calculated using the Catalan number:

$$
C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}
$$

For 6 words, \( C_6 = 132 \) possible trees, but grammar rules constrain valid trees.

#### Logic for Researchers

Constituency grammar excels at capturing hierarchical structures, making it ideal for tasks like syntactic parsing in English or generating parse trees for grammar correction. As a researcher, you can explore constituency-based models for tasks requiring phrase-level analysis, such as text generation or summarization.

#### Chart: Comparing Dependency and Constituency Grammar

To visualize the differences, here’s a chart comparing the number of nodes in dependency and constituency trees for sentences of varying lengths.

```chartjs
{
  "type": "line",
  "data": {
    "labels": ["2 words", "4 words", "6 words", "8 words"],
    "datasets": [
      {
        "label": "Dependency Nodes",
        "data": [2, 4, 6, 8],
        "borderColor": "#1f77b4",
        "backgroundColor": "#1f77b4",
        "fill": false
      },
      {
        "label": "Constituency Nodes",
        "data": [3, 7, 11, 15],
        "borderColor": "#ff7f0e",
        "backgroundColor": "#ff7f0e",
        "fill": false
      }
    ]
  },
  "options": {
    "title": {
      "display": true,
      "text": "Dependency vs. Constituency Tree Nodes"
    },
    "scales": {
      "x": {
        "title": {
          "display": true,
          "text": "Sentence Length (Words)"
        }
      },
      "y": {
        "title": {
          "display": true,
          "text": "Number of Nodes"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation**: The chart shows that constituency trees have more nodes ($$\approx 2n - 1$$) than dependency trees ($$n$$), reflecting their inclusion of phrase nodes.

#### Notes for Your Research

- **Dependency Grammar**: Best for flexible word-order languages and tasks focusing on word relationships (e.g., dependency parsing in spaCy).
- **Constituency Grammar**: Ideal for strict word-order languages and phrase-based tasks (e.g., grammar correction).
- **Research Idea**: Combine both in hybrid models for robust NLP parsers, like those in BERT or transformer-based systems.

## 2. Discourse: RST and Centering

Discourse analysis studies how sentences connect to form coherent texts or conversations. We’ll explore **Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST)** (logical relations between sentences) and **Centering Theory** (tracking entity focus).

### 2.1 Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST)

#### Theory

RST organizes a text into a tree where each node represents a rhetorical relation (e.g., Cause, Elaboration, Contrast) between text segments (sentences or clauses). Each relation has a **nucleus** (main idea) and **satellite** (supporting information), creating a hierarchical structure.

- **Analogy**: Think of a text as a recipe. The main instruction (nucleus) is “Bake the cake,” while supporting steps (satellites) like “Mix the ingredients” or “Because it ensures fluffiness” explain how or why. The recipe flows logically because of these connections.
- **Key Terms**:
  - **Nucleus**: The core idea or main point.
  - **Satellite**: Supporting details that enhance the nucleus.
  - **Relations**: Common types include:
    - **Elaboration**: Adds details (e.g., “The cake is chocolate. It has creamy frosting.”).
    - **Cause**: Explains why (e.g., “I was late. I missed the bus.”).
    - **Contrast**: Highlights differences (e.g., “I wanted tea. She chose coffee.”).
- **Why It’s Useful**: RST reveals the logical structure of texts, aiding in summarization and argumentation analysis.

#### Example

Text: “I missed the bus. I was late for work.”

- **Relation**: Cause.
- **Nucleus**: “I was late for work” (main consequence).
- **Satellite**: “I missed the bus” (reason for lateness).
- **Tree**:

```
       Cause
      /     \
 Nucleus   Satellite
   |           |
I was late  I missed
for work    the bus
```

#### Additional Example

Text: “The team won the game. They celebrated with a party.”

- **Relation**: Elaboration.
- **Nucleus**: “The team won the game.”
- **Satellite**: “They celebrated with a party” (adds detail).
- **Tree**:

```
       Elaboration
      /          \
 Nucleus       Satellite
   |              |
Team won       They celebrated
the game       with a party
```

#### Real-World Case

RST is used in **automatic summarization** tools. For instance, a news summarizer analyzing an article about a climate event might identify the nucleus (“Hurricane caused flooding”) and satellites (“Heavy rain fell for days” or “Evacuations were ordered”) to generate a summary: “Hurricane caused flooding due to heavy rain.” This ensures the summary captures the main point and key details.

#### Visualization

See the trees above, showing how nuclei and satellites connect.

#### Math

An RST tree for a text with \( m \) segments has

$$
m - 1
$$

relations. The complexity of RST parsing depends on the number of possible relations (e.g., 20–30 in standard RST frameworks).

**Calculation Example**:

- Text: “I missed the bus. I was late for work. My boss was upset.” (3 segments).
- Relations: 2 (Cause: 1→2; Elaboration: 2→3).
- Nodes: 3 segments + 2 relations = 5 nodes.
- **Parsing Probability**: Assume 20 possible relations per segment pair. For 2 relations, the number of possible trees is
  $$
  20^2 = 400
  $$
  but context reduces valid options.

#### Logic for Researchers

RST captures the rhetorical flow of a text, making it ideal for analyzing arguments, narratives, or persuasive writing. As a researcher, you can use RST to develop summarization algorithms or study discourse coherence in legal or scientific texts.

### 2.2 Centering Theory

#### Theory

Centering Theory explains how discourse maintains coherence by tracking the focus on entities (people, objects) across sentences. It identifies which entity is the “center” of attention and how focus shifts to keep the text coherent.

- **Analogy**: Imagine a spotlight in a play. The spotlight (attention) follows the main character (center) but may shift to others temporarily, ensuring the audience follows the story. If the spotlight jumps randomly, the play feels disjointed.
- **Key Terms**:
  - **Forward-Looking Centers (Cf)**: All entities mentioned in a sentence, ranked by grammatical role (e.g., subject > object).
  - **Backward-Looking Center (Cb)**: The entity linking to the previous sentence.
  - **Transitions**:
    - **Continue**: Same Cb as previous sentence (most coherent).
    - **Retain**: Cb is same, but a new entity is introduced for the next sentence.
    - **Shift**: New Cb (less coherent).
- **Why It’s Useful**: Centering ensures smooth focus transitions, critical for dialogue systems.

#### Example

Text:

1. “John saw a dog.”
2. “The dog barked at him.”
3. “He ran away.”

- **Sentence 1**:
  - Cf: {John, dog} (John as subject ranks higher).
  - Cb: None (first sentence).
- **Sentence 2**:
  - Cf: {dog, him} (dog as subject ranks higher).
  - Cb: dog (links to “a dog”).
  - Transition: Shift (new Cb: dog).
- **Sentence 3**:
  - Cf: {he} (he = John).
  - Cb: John (links to “him”).
  - Transition: Shift (new Cb: John).

#### Additional Example

Text:

1. “The book was on the table.”
2. “It was old and dusty.”

- **Sentence 1**:
  - Cf: {book, table}.
  - Cb: None.
- **Sentence 2**:
  - Cf: {it} (it = book).
  - Cb: book.
  - Transition: Continue (same Cb).

#### Real-World Case

Centering is used in **dialogue systems** like chatbots. For example, a customer service chatbot discussing a product return tracks the focus (e.g., “the product”) to respond coherently: User: “I bought a phone. It’s faulty.” Chatbot: “Sorry, let’s process its return.” The chatbot uses centering to link “it” to “phone,” avoiding confusion.

#### Visualization

```
Sentence 1: [John, dog] → Cb: None
Sentence 2: [dog, him] → Cb: dog (Shift)
Sentence 3: [he] → Cb: John (Shift)
```

#### Math

Centering quantifies coherence via transition probabilities:

- **Continue**: High coherence ($$ P = 0.9 $$).
- **Retain**: Moderate ($$ P = 0.7 $$).
- **Shift**: Low ($$ P = 0.5 $$).
- For $$ n $$ sentences, there are $$ n - 1 $$ transitions. The coherence score is:

$$
\text{Coherence score} = \prod_{i=1}^{n-1} P(\text{Transition}_i)
$$

**Calculation Example**:

- Text: 3 sentences (as above).
- Transitions: 2 (Shift, Shift).
- Coherence Score: $$ P(\text{Shift}) \times P(\text{Shift}) = 0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25 $$ (low coherence due to shifts).

#### Logic for Researchers

Centering ensures discourse coherence by tracking entity focus, making it essential for dialogue modeling and coherence analysis. As a researcher, you can explore centering in conversational AI or study coherence breakdowns in disordered speech.

---

## 3. Pragmatics: Anaphora and Coherence

Pragmatics studies how context shapes meaning beyond literal words. We’ll focus on **Anaphora** (referring to earlier entities) and **Coherence** (logical text flow).

### 3.1 Anaphora

#### Theory

Anaphora occurs when a word (anaphor) refers to an earlier entity (antecedent) in the discourse, reducing repetition and maintaining flow. It relies on context to resolve references.

- **Analogy**: Anaphora is like using a nickname in a story. Instead of repeating “Professor Smith” every sentence, you say “he” or “the professor,” trusting the reader knows who’s meant.
- **Key Terms**:
  - **Anaphor**: The referring word (e.g., “he,” “it”).
  - **Antecedent**: The entity referred to (e.g., “John,” “the book”).
  - **Types**:
    - **Pronominal**: “he,” “she,” “it.”
    - **Reflexive**: “himself,” “herself.”
    - **Definite NP**: “the book” referring to “a book.”
- **Why It’s Useful**: Anaphora makes texts concise but requires context for clarity.

#### Example

Text: “Mary bought a book. She read it quickly.”

- **Anaphors**: “She” (refers to Mary), “it” (refers to book).
- **Antecedents**: “Mary,” “a book.”
- **Resolution**: Link “She” to “Mary,” “it” to “book.”

#### Additional Example

Text: “The team won the match. They celebrated.”

- **Anaphors**: “They” (refers to team).
- **Antecedent**: “The team.”
- **Resolution**: “They” links to “the team.”

#### Real-World Case

Anaphora resolution is critical in **virtual assistants**. For example, in Amazon Alexa, if you say, “Play a song. Make it louder,” Alexa resolves “it” to “the song” to adjust volume. Incorrect resolution (e.g., linking “it” to “Alexa”) would cause errors.

#### Visualization

```
Mary → She
book → it
```

#### Math

Anaphora resolution is a classification problem. For \( k \) antecedents and \( m \) anaphors, compute probabilities for each pair using features like distance, grammatical role, and context:

$$
P(\text{anaphor}_i = \text{antecedent}_j \mid \text{features})
$$

$$
\text{where } i = 1, \ldots, m \text{ and } j = 1, \ldots, k.
$$

**Calculation Example**:

- Text: “Mary bought a book. She read it.”
- Anaphors: {She, it}.
- Antecedents: {Mary, book}.
- Pairs: {(She, Mary), (She, book), (it, Mary), (it, book)}.
- Probabilities (based on features like subject role):
  - $$ P(\text{She} = \text{Mary}) = 0.95 $$ (subject match).
  - $$ P(\text{it} = \text{book}) = 0.9 $$ (object match).
- Total assignments: Choose the highest-probability pair for each anaphor.

#### Logic for Researchers

Anaphora resolution is a core NLP challenge, requiring context-aware models. As a researcher, you can develop algorithms using transformers (e.g., BERT) to improve resolution accuracy in dialogues or texts.

### 3.2 Coherence

#### Theory

Coherence is the quality that makes a text logical and understandable. It depends on anaphoric links, logical relations (like RST), and thematic consistency.

- **Analogy**: A coherent text is like a well-directed movie. Each scene (sentence) connects logically, with characters (entities) referenced clearly and events flowing naturally.
- **Key Factors**:
  - **Anaphoric Links**: Pronouns tying to antecedents.
  - **Logical Relations**: Cause, elaboration, etc.
  - **Thematic Consistency**: Staying on topic.
- **Why It’s Useful**: Coherence ensures texts are easy to follow, critical for communication and AI.

#### Example

Coherent: “I went to the store. I bought milk because it was on sale.”
Incoherent: “I went to the store. The moon is bright.”

- **Coherent Text**: Uses anaphora (“I,” “it”) and a cause relation (“because”).
- **Incoherent Text**: Lacks logical or anaphoric connections.

#### Additional Example

Coherent: “The scientist published a paper. It was well-received.”
Incoherent: “The scientist published a paper. The car is red.”

- **Coherent**: “It” links to “paper,” and “well-received” elaborates.
- **Incoherent**: No connection between “paper” and “car.”

#### Real-World Case

Coherence is used in **automated essay scoring** systems like ETS’s e-rater. It evaluates essays by checking anaphoric links (e.g., pronouns matching nouns) and logical relations (e.g., cause, contrast), ensuring the essay flows logically. For example, a coherent essay on climate change connects sentences about causes and effects, while an incoherent one jumps between unrelated topics.

#### Visualization

```
Coherent:
[I went to store] → [I bought milk] → [because it was on sale]
(Anaphora: I, it; Relation: Cause)
```

#### Math

Coherence is quantified as the product of transition probabilities (from Centering) and relation weights (from RST). Assume:

- Continue: $$ P = 0.9 $$
- Cause: $$ P = 0.8 $$

**Calculation Example**:

- Text: “I went to the store. I bought milk because it was on sale.” (3 sentences).
- Transitions: 2 (Continue, Cause).
- Coherence Score:
  $$
  P(\text{Continue}) \times P(\text{Cause}) = 0.9 \times 0.8 = 0.72
  $$

#### Logic for Researchers

Coherence modeling enhances text generation and evaluation. As a researcher, you can develop coherence metrics for NLP systems or study coherence in multilingual texts.

## 4. Cognitive Constraints in Generation

#### Theory

Cognitive constraints describe how the brain’s limitations—working memory, attention, and cognitive load—affect language generation and comprehension. These constraints shape how we produce and process sentences, influencing AI design.

- **Analogy**: Generating a sentence is like building a Lego model with limited workspace. You can only handle a few pieces (words) at a time, so you organize them carefully to create a clear structure (sentence).
- **Key Constraints**:
  - **Working Memory**: Limited to ~7 ± 2 items (Miller’s Law), affecting how many words or phrases we can process.
  - **Attention**: Focus on key entities (like Centering’s Cb).
  - **Cognitive Load**: Effort required to process complex structures (e.g., nested clauses).
- **Why It’s Useful**: Understanding cognitive constraints helps design human-friendly AI systems and simplify texts.

#### Example

Complex: “The book, which Mary bought yesterday after browsing, is on the table.”

- **Working Memory**: Hold “the book” while processing the nested clause “which Mary bought yesterday after browsing.”
- **Attention**: Focus on “the book” as the main entity.
- **Cognitive Load**: High due to nested structure and multiple dependencies.

Simplified: “Mary bought the book yesterday. It’s on the table.”

- **Working Memory**: Easier to track “the book” across short sentences.
- **Attention**: Clear focus on “the book.”
- **Cognitive Load**: Lower due to simpler structure.

#### Additional Example

Complex: “The scientist, who discovered a new species in the Pacific, wrote a paper.”
Simplified: “The scientist discovered a new species. She wrote a paper.”

- **Simplified Version**: Reduces clause depth and dependency distance, easing cognitive load.

#### Real-World Case

Cognitive constraints are applied in **text simplification** for educational tools. For example, Rewordify simplifies complex texts for young readers by breaking long sentences and clarifying anaphora. A sentence like “The novel, which was written by Austen in 1813, explores love” becomes “Austen wrote the novel in 1813. It explores love,” aligning with working memory limits.

#### Visualization

```
Complex:
[The book [which Mary bought yesterday after browsing] is on the table]
(High cognitive load: nested clause)

Simplified:
[Mary bought the book yesterday] → [It’s on the table]
(Low cognitive load: short sentences)
```

#### Math

Cognitive load is quantified using:

- **Dependency Distance**: Average distance (in words) between dependent words.
- **Clause Depth**: Number of nested clauses.

**Calculation Example**:

- Complex: “The book, which Mary bought yesterday after browsing, is on the table.”
  - Dependency Distance: ~3.5 (e.g., “book” to “is” spans 7 words).
  - Clause Depth: 2 (main clause + relative clause).
- Simplified: “Mary bought the book yesterday. It’s on the table.”
  - Dependency Distance: ~1.5 (shorter dependencies).
  - Clause Depth: 1 (no nesting).
- Load Reduction: ~60% (based on reduced distance and depth).

**Formula**:

$$
\text{Cognitive Load} \approx w_1 \cdot \text{Dependency Distance} + w_2 \cdot \text{Clause Depth}
$$

where \( w_1, w_2 \) are weights (e.g., 0.6, 0.4).

#### Logic for Researchers

Cognitive constraints explain why simpler texts are easier to process, guiding AI to generate human-like language. As a researcher, you can explore cognitive load metrics in text simplification or study attention mechanisms in transformer models.
