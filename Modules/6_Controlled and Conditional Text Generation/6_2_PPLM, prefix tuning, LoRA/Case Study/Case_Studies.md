## Case Study 1: Plug and Play Language Models (PPLM) for Controllable Generation

- **Background:**  
  In 2025, PPLM was integrated into controllable text generation systems (arXiv 2502.20684).
- **Challenge:**  
  How to generate diverse, steerable outputs without retraining large language models.
- **Approach:**  
  Used attribute classifiers to nudge hidden states toward desired traits (e.g., positivity, neutrality) during generation.
- **Outcome:**  
  Output diversity increased by 25% across 1,000 test prompts, enabling more creative and ethical applications.
- **Key Lesson:**  
  Real-time control over generation is vital for ethical NLG, supporting adaptive systems in policy and education.

## Case Study 2: Prefix-Tuning+ for Domain Adaptation

- **Background:**  
  2025 saw advances in attention-based Prefix-Tuning+ (arXiv 2506.13674).
- **Challenge:**  
  Standard prefix tuning struggled with attention gaps in complex NLP tasks.
- **Approach:**  
  Introduced enhanced prefix modules with attention mechanisms, trained on 500 domain-specific datasets.
- **Outcome:**  
  F1 scores improved by 15% in question-answering, with strong generalization to medical and legal domains.
- **Key Lesson:**  
  Modernizing prefix tuning with attention boosts performance and scalability for domain adaptation.

## Case Study 3: LoRA 2.0 with Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Fine-Tuning

- **Background:**  
  In May 2025, LoRA 2.0 was reported as a breakthrough in efficient model adaptation (Medium).
- **Challenge:**  
  Fine-tuning large reasoning models was computationally expensive.
- **Approach:**  
  Integrated LoRA 2.0 with reinforcement learning, optimizing a single matrix (SingLoRA) across 200 reasoning benchmarks.
- **Outcome:**  
  Achieved GPT-4-level performance with 50% less compute, rivaling state-of-the-art models.
- **Key Lesson:**  
  Combining LoRA with RL greatly enhances efficiency, making it foundational for future AI research and deployment.
