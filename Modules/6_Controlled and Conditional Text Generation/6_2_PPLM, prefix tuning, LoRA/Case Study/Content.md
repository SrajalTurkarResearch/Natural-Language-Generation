## 1. Foundations Recap

- **Theory:**

  - NLG enables machines to generate human-like text.
  - Large Language Models (LLMs) use transformer architectures for next-token prediction.
  - _2025 Focus:_ Efficiency and controllability.

- **Mathematics:**

  - Probability: P(next | previous) via attention mechanisms.

- **Challenges:**

  - Model size
  - Bias
  - Computational cost

- **Visualization:**
