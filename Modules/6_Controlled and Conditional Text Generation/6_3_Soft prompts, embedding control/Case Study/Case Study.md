## Case Study 1: Healthcare – Clinical Report Generation

- **Source:** PMC, 2024 – _SPeC: Soft Prompt Calibration for Clinical Summaries_
- **Problem:** Inconsistent performance in summarizing patient notes due to domain-specific terminology.
- **Solution:** Applied soft prompt tuning on medical datasets (e.g., MIMIC-III). Calibrated prompts were designed to adapt to clinical jargon.
- **Outcome:** Improved report accuracy (ROUGE score increased by 15%) and reduced errors in medical terminology.
- **Research Insight:** Perturbations in the calibration prompt tuning (CPT) process ensure stable training, which is critical for medical reliability.

## Case Study 2: Information Retrieval – Enhanced Search

- **Source:** ScienceDirect, 2025 – _SPTAR: Soft Prompt Tuning for Augmented Retrieval_
- **Problem:** Dense retrieval models struggle with limited training data, reducing search effectiveness.
- **Solution:** Fine-tuned soft prompts on retrieval tasks, enabling control over embedding relevance.
- **Outcome:** Improved search precision (NDCG increased by 10%) and generated more relevant summaries.
- **Research Insight:** Soft prompts significantly enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for scientific literature.

## Case Study 3: Controllable Text Generation

- **Source:** arXiv, 2024 – _Controllable NLG with Soft Prompts_
- **Problem:** Difficulty in steering text style (e.g., formal, creative) without retraining large models.
- **Solution:** Used embedding control via soft prompts, trained on style-specific datasets.
- **Outcome:** Achieved precise style control in chatbots (e.g., formal customer service responses).
- **Research Insight:** Mixture of Soft Prompts (MSP) enables multi-style generation, making it ideal for versatile NLG applications.

## Case Study 4: Synthetic Data for Privacy

- **Source:** OpenReview, 2024 – _Mixture of Soft Prompts for Synthetic Data_
- **Problem:** Data scarcity and privacy concerns in sensitive domains such as healthcare.
- **Solution:** Employed MSP to generate diverse, privacy-preserving synthetic texts.
- **Outcome:** Produced high-quality datasets for training without compromising patient data privacy.
- **Research Insight:** Combining multiple prompts balances diversity and fidelity, which is key for ethical AI development.
