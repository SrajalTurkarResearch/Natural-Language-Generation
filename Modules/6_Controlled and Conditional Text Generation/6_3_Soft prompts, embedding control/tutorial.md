# Comprehensive Tutorial: Soft Prompts and Embedding Control in NLG

## Section 1: Foundations of NLG and Prompts

### 1.1 What is NLG?

**Natural Language Generation (NLG)** is the AI process of creating human-like text from inputs like data, keywords, or instructions. It’s like a robot storyteller turning raw facts into a compelling narrative.

- **Why it matters for you**: As a scientist, NLG can automate writing research papers, generate hypotheses, or explain complex data (e.g., turning experiment results into a report). Imagine Einstein using NLG to draft his relativity papers faster!
- **How it works**:
  1. **Input**: Data (e.g., numbers, prompts).
  2. **Processing**: A model (like GPT or BERT) interprets the input.
  3. **Output**: Coherent text (e.g., a summary or story).
- **Example**: Input = "Weather: 25°C, sunny"; Output = "It’s a sunny day with a pleasant 25°C."

**Analogy**: NLG is like a chef (the model) cooking a dish (text) from ingredients (data). The better the recipe, the tastier the dish.

**Research Angle**: NLG saves time, letting you focus on experiments, not writing.

**Notes**: "NLG = Data → Model → Text. Automates communication for science."

### 1.2 What are Prompts?

Prompts are instructions you give an NLG model to guide its output, like whispering a plot to a storyteller.

- **Types**:
  - **Hard Prompts**: Fixed text (e.g., "Write a poem about stars").
  - **Soft Prompts**: Trainable vectors (not text) that learn to guide the model (our focus).
- **Why Prompts?**: Without them, models might generate random or irrelevant text, like a ship without a compass.
- **Example**: Hard prompt: "Explain quantum physics simply." Output: A beginner-friendly explanation.

**Logic**: Prompts set the model’s focus, aligning its vast knowledge to your task.

**Notes**: "Prompts = Instructions. Hard = Text, Soft = Vectors."

## Section 2: Understanding Embeddings

Embeddings are the numerical "language" of AI models. Let’s break them down as if you’re seeing them for the first time.

### 2.1 What are Embeddings?

Embeddings are vectors (lists of numbers) that represent text in a high-dimensional space, capturing meaning.

- **Definition**: A word like "cat" becomes a vector, e.g., [0.1, -0.2, 0.5, ...] in 768 dimensions (depends on the model).
- **Purpose**: Computers don’t understand words, only numbers. Embeddings place similar words (e.g., "cat" and "kitten") close together in this space.
- **How Made**: Pre-trained models (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT) learn embeddings from massive text data, analyzing word contexts.

**Analogy**: Picture a library where books (words) are shelved by topic. "Cat" and "kitten" are on nearby shelves; "cat" and "car" are far apart. Embeddings are the coordinates of these shelves.

**Example**: In Google Search, searching "cat" finds "feline" because their embeddings are close.

### 2.2 Embeddings in NLG

In NLG, text inputs are converted to embeddings, processed by a transformer model, and decoded back to text.

- **Process**:
  1. **Tokenization**: Split text into tokens (e.g., "The cat" → ["The", "cat"]).
  2. **Embedding**: Map tokens to vectors (e.g., [[0.2, 0.1], [0.5, -0.3]]).
  3. **Transformer**: Process embeddings through neural layers.
  4. **Decoding**: Convert final embeddings to text.

**Why for Scientists?**: Embeddings are the "DNA" of language. Controlling them (via soft prompts) lets you shape outputs, like Tesla tweaking circuits for precise electricity flow.

**Visualization** (Sketch this):

```
Y: Pet-like
^ Cat *  Kitten *
|       Dog *
| Car *
+-------> X: Animal-like
```

- "Cat" at (3,4), "Kitten" at (3.2,4.1), "Car" at (1,1). Closer points = Similar meanings.

**Notes**: "Embeddings = Vectors of meaning. Similar text → Close vectors."

## Section 3: Hard Prompts vs. Soft Prompts

### 3.1 Hard Prompts

- **Definition**: Fixed text instructions, e.g., "Summarize Einstein’s relativity in 100 words."
- **Pros**:
  - Simple to write.
  - No training needed.
- **Cons**:
  - Inflexible: Changing tone or style requires a new prompt.
  - Inefficient for large models (e.g., GPT-4), as they can’t adapt dynamically.
- **Example**: Prompt: "Describe a black hole." Output: A basic description.

### 3.2 Soft Prompts

- **Definition**: Trainable vectors (not text) prepended to input embeddings. They’re optimized during training to guide the model.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Learnable**: Adjusted via data, not hand-written.
  - **Efficient**: Only train the prompt vectors, not the entire model (crucial for billion-parameter models).
- **Why Better?**: Retraining a huge model is like rebuilding a rocket from scratch. Soft prompts tweak only the "control panel," saving compute power.

**Analogy**: Hard prompt = A handwritten recipe ("Make spicy soup"). Soft prompt = A digital recipe that learns to perfect the flavor through taste tests.

**Real-World Case**: In legal NLG, hard prompts struggle with niche terms (e.g., contract clauses). Soft prompts learn from examples to generate precise text.

**Logic**: Soft prompts act as a "learned context" in the embedding space, making NLG adaptable and efficient.

**Notes**: "Hard: Fixed text, rigid. Soft: Trainable vectors, efficient for big models."

## Section 4: Deep Theory of Soft Prompts

### 4.1 How Soft Prompts Work

Soft prompts replace text prompts with k trainable vectors, prepended to the input embeddings. The model’s weights stay frozen; only the prompt vectors are updated.

- **Process**:
  $$
  \begin{align*}
  &\text{1. Initialize soft prompt as random vectors: } \mathbf{P} = [\mathbf{p_1}, \mathbf{p_2}, ..., \mathbf{p_k}], \quad \mathbf{p_i} \in \mathbb{R}^d \\
  &\text{2. Input embeddings: } \mathbf{I} = [\mathbf{e_1}, ..., \mathbf{e_n}] \\
  &\text{3. Combine: } \mathbf{Input} = \mathbf{P} \oplus \mathbf{I} \\
  &\text{4. Feed to transformer: } f(\mathbf{Input}) \rightarrow \text{Output}
  \end{align*}
  $$

**Step-by-Step Process (Formatted):**

1. **Initialize Soft Prompt**:  
   Initialize \( k \) soft prompt vectors as random values:

   $$
   \mathbf{P} = [\mathbf{p}_1, \mathbf{p}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{p}_k], \quad \mathbf{p}_i \in \mathbb{R}^d
   $$

   where \( d \) is the embedding dimension (e.g., 768).

2. **Obtain Input Embeddings**:  
   Convert the input tokens to embeddings:

   $$
   \mathbf{I} = [\mathbf{e}_1, \mathbf{e}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{e}_n]
   $$

3. **Combine Soft Prompt and Input**:  
   Concatenate (prepend) the soft prompt vectors to the input embeddings:

   $$
   \mathbf{Input} = \mathbf{P} \oplus \mathbf{I}
   $$

   where \( \oplus \) denotes concatenation.

4. **Feed to Transformer**:  
   Pass the combined embeddings through the (frozen) transformer model:
   $$
   \text{Output} = f(\mathbf{Input})
   $$
5. Train P to minimize loss (e.g., error in generating correct text).

- **Why for Researchers?**: This is **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**. It lets you adapt massive models (e.g., LLaMA) for specific tasks without supercomputers, like Turing optimizing his code-breaking machines.

**Analogy**: Soft prompts are like tuning a radio to the perfect station (output style) without rebuilding the radio (model).

### 4.2 Embedding Control in NLG

Embedding control manipulates vectors to steer the model’s output toward desired traits (e.g., formal tone, scientific style).

- **Techniques**:
  - **Addition**: Add a vector to push toward a trait (e.g., "positive").
  - **Subtraction**: Remove unwanted traits (e.g., "negative").
  - **Interpolation**: Blend embeddings for nuanced control.
- **In Soft Prompts**: The trainable vectors learn optimal positions in the embedding space to guide the model.

**Real-World Case**: In customer service, soft prompts ensure chatbots respond politely by learning embeddings aligned with positive sentiment.

**Logic**: Transformers process embeddings sequentially. Soft prompts set the initial context, influencing all downstream layers.

**Notes**: "Soft Prompts: Prepend k vectors → Train only them → Steer output. Control: Manipulate vectors for style/domain."

## Section 5: Mathematics of Soft Prompts and Embedding Control

Math is your researcher’s superpower. Let’s derive it step-by-step, like Einstein tackling relativity, but keep it beginner-friendly.

### 5.1 Embeddings Math

- A token \( w \) (e.g., "cat") maps to a vector:

  $$
  \mathbf{e}_w \in \mathbb{R}^d
  $$

  where \( d \) is the dimension (e.g., 768 for BERT).

- For a sentence, concatenate or average the token vectors:
  $$
  \text{Sentence Embedding} = [\mathbf{e}_{w_1}, \mathbf{e}_{w_2}, \ldots, \mathbf{e}_{w_n}]
  $$
  or
  $$
  \text{Avg} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{e}_{w_i}
  $$

**Example**:  
"The cat" → Tokens: ["The", "cat"]  
Embeddings:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0.2 & 0.1 & \ldots \\
0.5 & -0.3 & \ldots
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### 5.2 Soft Prompt Setup

- Soft prompt:
  $$
  \mathbf{P} = [\mathbf{p}_1, \mathbf{p}_2, \ldots, \mathbf{p}_k], \quad \mathbf{p}_i \in \mathbb{R}^d
  $$
- Input embeddings:
  $$
  \mathbf{I} = [\mathbf{e}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{e}_n]
  $$
- Combined input:
  $$
  \mathbf{Input} = \mathbf{P} \oplus \mathbf{I}
  $$
- Model output:
  $$
  f(\mathbf{Input})
  $$
  where \( f \) is the transformer.

### 5.3 Training Soft Prompts

- **Goal**: Minimize loss \( L \), e.g., cross-entropy for text generation:
  $$
  L = -\sum \log P(\text{target word} \mid \text{previous words})
  $$
- **Optimization**: Update only \( \mathbf{P} \) via gradient descent:
  $$
  \mathbf{P}^{\text{new}} = \mathbf{P}^{\text{old}} - \eta \nabla_{\mathbf{P}} L
  $$
  $$
  \eta = \text{learning rate (e.g., 0.01)}
  $$

**Complete Example Calculation**:

- **Setup**: \( d = 2 \), \( k = 1 \) (one soft prompt token), task: Generate "The movie was good."
- **Input**: "The movie was"
  $$
  \mathbf{I} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0.5 & 0.3
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
- **Initial Soft Prompt**:
  $$
  \mathbf{P}^{(0)} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0.1 & 0.1
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
- **Combined Input**:
  $$
  \mathbf{Input} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0.1 & 0.1 \\
  0.5 & 0.3
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
- **Model Prediction**: "bad"
  $$
  L = 1
  $$
- **Gradient**:
  $$
  \nabla_{\mathbf{P}} L =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0.2 & -0.1
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
- **Update Rule**:
  $$
  \eta = 0.1
  $$
  $$
  \mathbf{P}^{(1)} = \mathbf{P}^{(0)} - \eta \nabla_{\mathbf{P}} L =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0.1 - 0.1 \times 0.2 & 0.1 - 0.1 \times (-0.1)
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0.08 & 0.11
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
- **Iterate**: Repeat the process until the output is "good" (i.e., loss \( L \) is near 0).

### 5.4 Embedding Control Math

To steer output (e.g., to "happy"):

$$
\mathbf{e}_{\text{controlled}} = \mathbf{e} + \lambda (\mathbf{e}_{\text{happy}} - \mathbf{e}_{\text{neutral}})
$$

where \( \lambda \) is the strength (between 0 and 1).

**Example Calculation:**

- Input:
  $$
  \mathbf{e} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0.5 & 0.3
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
- Happy:
  $$
  \mathbf{e}_{\text{happy}} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0.7 & 0.6
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
- Neutral:
  $$
  \mathbf{e}_{\text{neutral}} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0.4 & 0.2
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
- Difference:
  $$
  \mathbf{e}_{\text{happy}} - \mathbf{e}_{\text{neutral}} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0.7 - 0.4 & 0.6 - 0.2
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0.3 & 0.4
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
- With \( \lambda = 0.5 \):
  $$
  \mathbf{e}_{\text{controlled}} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0.5 & 0.3
  \end{bmatrix}
  + 0.5 \times
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0.3 & 0.4
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0.5 + 0.15 & 0.3 + 0.2
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  0.65 & 0.5
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

**Visualization**:

```
Neutral * ----> Happy *
Input * ----> Controlled *
```

- Arrows show vector addition shifting meaning.

**Logic**: Vectors are directions in meaning space. Adding/subtracting shifts the output, like Turing manipulating symbols.

**Notes**: Copy equations; practice with d=2.

## Section 6: Practical Implementation Examples

### 6.1 Soft Prompt for Sentiment

- **Task**: Fine-tune GPT-2 to generate positive movie reviews.
- **Code** (Using HuggingFace PEFT):

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from peft import PromptTuningConfig, get_peft_model
import torch

# Load model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")

# Soft prompt config
config = PromptTuningConfig(
    task_type="CAUSAL_LM",
    num_virtual_tokens=5,
    prompt_tuning_init="TEXT",
    prompt_tuning_init_text="Generate a positive review:"
)
peft_model = get_peft_model(model, config)

# Train (simplified)
inputs = tokenizer("The movie was", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = peft_model(**inputs)
# Train on IMDB positive reviews dataset
# Optimizer updates only soft prompt

# Generate
generated = peft_model.generate(**inputs, max_length=50)
print(tokenizer.decode(generated[0]))
# Output: "The movie was amazing, with stunning visuals!"
```

- **Why?**: Soft prompts learn to steer toward positivity without retraining the model.

### 6.2 Embedding Control

- **Task**: Make output more formal.
- **Code**:

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import torch

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
text = "The results are good."
formal = "The outcomes are satisfactory."
neutral = "The results are okay."

# Get embeddings
e_text = model.encode(text)
e_formal = model.encode(formal)
e_neutral = model.encode(neutral)

# Control
lambda_ = 0.5
e_controlled = e_text + lambda_ * (e_formal - e_neutral)
```

- **Why?**: Directly shifts embeddings to enforce style.

**Notes**: "Soft prompts via PEFT. Control: Add/subtract vectors."

## Section 7: Real-World Applications

- **Healthcare**: Soft prompts generate accurate medical reports (e.g., "X-ray shows reduced inflammation"). Real case: IBM Watson uses PEFT for drug discovery summaries.
- **Education**: Generate tailored lessons. Soft prompts adjust for beginner vs. advanced learners. Real case: Duolingo’s NLG for exercises.
- **Ethics**: Control embeddings to reduce bias (subtract harmful vectors). Real case: OpenAI moderates outputs this way.
- **Science**: Automate hypothesis generation (e.g., "Data suggests X correlates with Y").

**Logic**: Soft prompts adapt NLG to niche domains; embedding control ensures precision.

## Section 8: Visualizations

### 8.1 Embedding Space

```
Y: Sentiment
^ Positive * (Soft prompt pulls here)
| Neutral * ---- Negative *
+-------> X: Tone
```

- Soft prompts shift inputs toward desired regions.

### 8.2 Flow Diagram

```
Text → Tokenize → Embed → Add Soft Prompt → Transformer → Decode → Output
```
