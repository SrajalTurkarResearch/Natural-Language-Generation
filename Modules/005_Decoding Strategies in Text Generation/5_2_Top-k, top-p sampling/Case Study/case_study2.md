# Case Study 2: Google Bard and Top-p Sampling

- **Context:**  
  Google's Bard, a conversational AI, employs variants of top-p (nucleus) sampling to generate fluent and contextually relevant responses.

- **Details:**  
  Bard utilizes top-p sampling to minimize "hallucinations"—incoherent or factually incorrect outputs—by concentrating on a nucleus of high-probability tokens. For instance, when prompted with "Explain quantum computing," Bard produces diverse yet accurate explanations, avoiding low-probability, off-topic content.

- **Impact:**  
  This approach enhances user trust in conversational AI for educational and professional applications. The adaptive nature of top-p allows Bard to handle ambiguous or open-ended queries more effectively than fixed top-k sampling.

- **Research Takeaway:**  
  Explore how top-p sampling can reduce biases and factual errors in conversational AI, particularly in scientific and technical communication.
