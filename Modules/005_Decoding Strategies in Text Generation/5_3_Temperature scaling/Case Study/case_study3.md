# Case Study 3: Machine Translation

**Context:**  
Google researchers set the temperature parameter to **T = 0.2** to boost BLEU scores by **5%** in low-resource language translation tasks. This low temperature favored more accurate, reliable translations, while higher temperatures were used for generating paraphrases.

**Application:**

- Real-time translation apps (e.g., Google Translate) employ adaptive temperature scaling to adjust output diversity based on context.

**Rare Insight:**

- Drawing from Tesla's engineering principles, optimizing temperature is akin to tuning voltage in circuitsâ€”balancing efficiency and signal clarity in language transmission.

**Real-World Impact:**

- Enhanced cross-cultural communication in global business
- Fewer errors in legal and technical translations
