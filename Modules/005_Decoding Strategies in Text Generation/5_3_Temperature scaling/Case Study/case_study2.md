# Case Study 2: NLG in Healthcare

In a 2022 case study<sup>1</sup>, temperature scaling in **BioGPT** improved biomedical abstract generation. By setting the temperature parameter to **T = 0.6**, researchers observed a **15% increase in accuracy** while maintaining a balance between factuality and creativity for hypothesis generation.

**Applications:**

- **Patient Reports:** Use a low temperature (T) for generating factual, reliable content.
- **Exploratory Diagnoses:** Use a higher T to encourage creative, hypothesis-driven outputs.

**Rare Insight:**  
This approach is analogous to Einstein's thought experimentsâ€”using a high temperature simulates "what-if" scenarios in medical research, fostering innovative thinking.

**Real-World Impact:**

- Enhanced drug discovery pipelines
- Accelerated hypothesis testing in pharmaceutical labs
