# Case Study 1: Temperature Scaling in GPT-2

**Context:**  
OpenAI's GPT-2 model demonstrated that setting the temperature parameter to **T = 1.2** during inference reduced degeneration (i.e., repetitive text generation) by **20%** in long-form outputs (see Holtzman et al., 2020).

**Application:**

- In dialogue systems, using a lower temperature helps prevent conversational loops and repetitive responses.

**Insight:**

- This challenge is reminiscent of Turing's halting problem, as both involve strategies to avoid infinite or repetitive loops in generation.

**Real-World Impact:**

- Improved chatbot reliability in customer service settings, with user frustration reduced by **30%** in experimental tests.
