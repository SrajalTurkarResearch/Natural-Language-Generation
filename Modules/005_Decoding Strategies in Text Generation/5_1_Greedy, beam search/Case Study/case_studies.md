## Case Study 1: Beam Search in Machine Translation

- **Context:** Google Translate (2021-2025), Width.ai, Analytics Vidhya
- **Details:**
  - Beam search replaced greedy decoding to handle ambiguous phrases (e.g., "bank" as river or finance).
  - Beam width $K=4$ improved BLEU scores by 20–30% by exploring multiple paths, ensuring contextual accuracy.
  - **Challenge:** Large beams slow inference; optimized $K$ balances speed and quality.
- **Research Insight:**
  - Experiment with beam width to minimize latency in production systems.

## Case Study 2: Greedy Search in Real-Time Chatbots

- **Context:** Early Siri, basic GPT models (Quora, Reddit, 2018-2024)
- **Details:**
  - Greedy decoding enabled fast responses but caused repetitive outputs (e.g., "I don't know" loops).
  - Transition to sampling or beam improved quality.
  - **Analogy:** In operations research, greedy product selection optimizes cost but misses value (e.g., choosing cheap parts over durable ones).
- **Research Insight:**
  - Use greedy as a baseline to quantify improvements in your NLG experiments.

## Case Study 3: Beam Search in Speech Recognition and Legal Documents

- **Context:** Speech-to-text and legal NLG (Medium, 2023)
- **Details:**
  - Beam search in ASR (e.g., financial report transcription) reduced errors by 50% in noisy settings by exploring alternative transcriptions.
  - In legal NLG, beam handled complex jargon, avoiding greedy's hallucinations (e.g., incorrect terms).
  - **Example:** "Contract breach" vs. greedy's "contract break."
- **Research Insight:**
  - Test beam on domain-specific datasets (e.g., legal texts) to study jargon handling.

## Case Study 4: Pitfalls in NLG

- **Context:** Academic research (arXiv 2204, ScienceDirect, 2022-2024)
- **Details:**
  - Beam search can degrade with large beams due to length bias, sometimes underperforming greedy.
  - **Example:** Overlong translations lose focus.
  - **Solution:** Length normalization ($\text{score}/|y|^{0.6}$).
  - Greedy fails in mathematical NLG (AI StackExchange), e.g., generating incorrect proof steps.
- **Research Insight:**
  - Implement length normalization in your beam search code to enhance performance.

## Case Study 5: Speculative Decoding Advances

- **Context:** NAACL 2025, X posts (@\_akhaliq, 2024)
- **Details:**
  - Apple's Recurrent Drafter uses greedy drafts verified by beam, speeding NLG 4x in code generation (e.g., decompiling binaries with fewer errors).
  - Combines greedy speed with beam accuracy.
  - **Example:** Generating Python from C++ snippets.
- **Research Insight:**
  - Explore hybrid decoding in your projects for efficiency gains.
