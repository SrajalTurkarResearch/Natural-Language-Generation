# Research Proposal: Contextual Consistency Score (CCS) for Hallucination Detection

## Introduction

Hallucinations in long-form generated text—unsubstantiated or inconsistent information—pose a challenge for reliable NLP systems. Existing metrics like BLEU or BERTScore focus on surface-level or semantic similarity but fail to capture contextual or factual inconsistencies across extended responses. This proposal introduces the **Contextual Consistency Score (CCS)** , a novel metric to detect hallucinations by combining semantic coherence and factual alignment.

## Problem Statement

Long-form text generation (e.g., essays, dialogues) often introduces subtle inconsistencies, such as contradicting earlier statements or fabricating facts not grounded in the input context or external knowledge. Current metrics lack the ability to evaluate consistency over long contexts or verify factual correctness systematically.

## Proposed Metric: CCS

The CCS metric evaluates generated text by measuring:

1. **Intra-Text Coherence** : Semantic consistency across sentences using contextual embeddings.
2. **Factual Alignment** : Consistency with external knowledge bases or input context using retrieval-based checks.

### Methodology

1. **Intra-Text Coherence** :

- Split the generated text into sentences ( S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_n ).
- Compute sentence embeddings using a pretrained model (e.g., BERT): ( e_i = \text{BERT}(S_i) ).
- Calculate pairwise cosine similarities: ( \text{sim}(e_i, e_j) = \frac{e_i \cdot e_j}{|e_i| |e_j|} ).
- Aggregate similarities to compute a coherence score: ( C = \frac{1}{n(n-1)/2} \sum\_{i<j} \text{sim}(e_i, e_j) ).
- Low coherence indicates potential hallucinations due to inconsistent semantics.

1. **Factual Alignment** :

- Extract key entities and claims from the text using an NER model and dependency parsing.
- Query a knowledge base (e.g., Wikipedia, Wikidata) to verify claims.
- Compute a factual alignment score: ( F = \frac{\text{# verified claims}}{\text{# total claims}} ).
- Low factual alignment suggests hallucinated content.

1. **CCS Formula** :

- Combine coherence and factual alignment: ( \text{CCS} = \alpha C + (1-\alpha) F ), where ( \alpha \in [0,1] ) balances the two components (e.g., ( \alpha = 0.5 )).
- CCS ranges from 0 to 1, with lower scores indicating higher likelihood of hallucinations.

### Example Calculation

**Generated Text** : "The Eiffel Tower, built in 1889, is in Florida. It was designed by Gustave Eiffel."

- **Coherence** :
- Sentences: ( S_1 ): "The Eiffel Tower, built in 1889, is in Florida." ( S_2 ): "It was designed by Gustave Eiffel."
- Embeddings: ( e_1, e_2 ) from BERT.
- Cosine similarity: ( \text{sim}(e_1, e_2) = 0.85 ).
- Coherence score: ( C = 0.85 ).
- **Factual Alignment** :
- Claims: (1) Eiffel Tower built in 1889, (2) located in Florida, (3) designed by Gustave Eiffel.
- Verification: (1) True, (2) False, (3) True.
- Factual score: ( F = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67 ).
- **CCS** : With ( \alpha = 0.5 ), ( \text{CCS} = 0.5 \cdot 0.85 + 0.5 \cdot 0.67 = 0.425 + 0.335 = 0.76 ).
- Interpretation: A CCS of 0.76 suggests moderate consistency, with the factual error (Florida) lowering the score.

## Implementation Plan

- **Tools** : Python, Hugging Face Transformers (BERT), spaCy (NER), Wikidata API.
- **Data** : Use datasets like FEVER or MultiWOZ to test CCS on fact-checked or dialogue data.
- **Evaluation** : Compare CCS against human judgments and existing metrics (e.g., BLEU, BERTScore) on hallucination detection tasks.

## Research Significance

- **Advancement** : CCS addresses gaps in existing metrics by explicitly modeling long-context consistency and factual grounding.
- **Applications** : Improves reliability in dialogue systems, scientific report generation, and automated journalism.
- **Future Directions** : Explore dynamic ( \alpha ) tuning, incorporate multimodal fact-checking (e.g., images), and test on low-resource languages.

## Conclusion

The CCS metric offers a robust approach to detecting hallucinations in long-form text, combining semantic and factual analysis. By implementing and validating CCS, researchers can enhance the trustworthiness of NLG systems, aligning with ethical AI goals.
