# Tutorial: Aggregation and Lexicalization in NLG

## 1. Introduction to NLG

**What is NLG?**  
Natural Language Generation (NLG) is an AI field where computers create human-readable text from data (e.g., tables, numbers) or knowledge (e.g., facts). Think of it as a translator turning raw data into sentences you’d read in a news article or hear from a virtual assistant like Siri.

**Why Aggregation and Lexicalization Matter**:

- **Aggregation**: Combines multiple data points into concise sentences, avoiding repetition. It’s like summarizing a long list of facts into one clear statement.
- **Lexicalization**: Picks the right words to make text natural and precise, like choosing “warm” instead of “22°C” for a weather report.  
  Together, they make NLG outputs clear, natural, and engaging—key for applications like automated reports or chatbots.

**Analogy**: NLG is like baking a cake. Aggregation gathers ingredients (data) and mixes them into batter (sentences). Lexicalization adds frosting and decorations (words) to make it appealing.

## 2. Aggregation in NLG

### 2.1 What is Aggregation?

Aggregation combines multiple related data points into a single, concise sentence to reduce redundancy and improve readability. Without it, NLG outputs can sound robotic or repetitive.

**Purpose**:

- Avoid repetition (e.g., don’t say “It’s sunny. It’s warm.”).
- Make text concise and natural.
- Ensure logical flow.

**Example**:  
**Input (Raw Data)**:

- Sky: Sunny
- Temperature: 25°C
- Humidity: Low

**Without Aggregation**:

- The sky is sunny.
- The temperature is 25°C.
- The humidity is low.

**With Aggregation**:

- It’s sunny with a temperature of 25°C and low humidity.

**Analogy**: Aggregation is like packing a lunchbox. Instead of carrying separate containers for rice, vegetables, and chicken, you mix them into one balanced meal (sentence).

### 2.2 Types of Aggregation

Here are common ways to aggregate data:

1. **Simple Conjunction**: Use “and” or “but” to join facts.

   - **Input**: John likes tea. John likes coffee.
   - **Output**: John likes tea and coffee.

2. **Syntactic Coordination**: Combine facts with shared subjects or verbs.

   - **Input**: The car is fast. The car is red.
   - **Output**: The car is fast and red.

3. **Ellipsis**: Drop redundant words when combining.

   - **Input**: Alice went to the park. Alice played tennis.
   - **Output**: Alice went to the park and played tennis.

4. **Set Introduction**: List items as a group.

   - **Input**: The store sells apples. The store sells bananas.
   - **Output**: The store sells apples and bananas.

5. **Temporal Aggregation**: Combine based on time.

   - **Input**: It rained in the morning. It was sunny in the afternoon.
   - **Output**: It rained in the morning but was sunny in the afternoon.

6. **Causal Aggregation**: Show cause-and-effect.
   - **Input**: The road was icy. There was a crash.
   - **Output**: The icy road caused a crash.

### 2.3 Real-World Examples

1. **Weather App**:

   - **Input**: Temp: 20°C, Sky: Clear, Wind: 5 km/h.
   - **Output**: It’s clear with a temperature of 20°C and light winds.
   - **Why?** Combines weather data for a concise forecast.

2. **Sports Report**:

   - **Input**: Team A scored 3 goals. Player X scored 2 goals.
   - **Output**: Team A scored 3 goals, with 2 by Player X.
   - **Why?** Merges related stats into a single sentence.

3. **Medical Summary**:
   - **Input**: Patient has fever. Patient’s temperature is 38°C.
   - **Output**: The patient has a fever with a temperature of 38°C.
   - **Why?** Combines symptoms for clarity.

### 2.4 Step-by-Step Aggregation Process

**Scenario**: You’re designing an NLG system for a weather app.  
**Input Data**:

- Temperature: 18°C
- Sky: Partly cloudy
- Wind: 8 km/h

**Steps**:

1. **Identify Related Facts**: All are weather conditions for one location and time.
2. **Choose Aggregation Type**: Use simple conjunction and syntactic coordination.
3. **Combine Facts**:
   - Start: “It’s partly cloudy.”
   - Add temperature: “It’s partly cloudy with a temperature of 18°C.”
   - Add wind: “It’s partly cloudy with a temperature of 18°C and winds at 8 km/h.”
4. **Refine**: Ensure it sounds natural.

**Output**: “It’s partly cloudy with a temperature of 18°C and winds at 8 km/h.”

### 2.5 Visualization

Think of aggregation as a funnel:

- **Input**: Separate data points (Temp, Sky, Wind).
- **Process**: Group → Combine with conjunctions → Refine.
- **Output**: One sentence.

**Diagram (for your notes)**:

```
[Temp: 18°C]  [Sky: Partly cloudy]  [Wind: 8 km/h]
       |                |                  |
       +----------------+------------------+
                    |
             [Aggregation]
                    |
    [Output: It’s partly cloudy with a temperature of 18°C and winds at 8 km/h.]
```

## 3. Lexicalization in NLG

### 3.1 What is Lexicalization?

Lexicalization is choosing the right words or phrases to express data or concepts, making the text natural, precise, and suited to the audience.

**Purpose**:

- Turn abstract data (e.g., “Temp = 20°C”) into readable words (e.g., “It’s warm”).
- Match the audience’s needs (e.g., simple words for public, technical terms for experts).
- Ensure clarity and cultural fit.

**Example**:  
**Input**: Temperature = 15°C.  
**Without Lexicalization**: “The temperature is 15 degrees Celsius.”  
**With Lexicalization**: “It’s cool at 15°C.”

**Analogy**: Lexicalization is like picking the right tool for a job. A hammer (word like “hot”) works better for a nail (weather report) than a screwdriver (technical term like “30°C”).

### 3.2 Types of Lexicalization

1. **Concept-to-Word**: Map data to descriptive words.

   - **Input**: Temp = 25°C.
   - **Output**: “It’s warm.”

2. **Entity Naming**: Use specific names or pronouns.

   - **Input**: Person = Mary, Action = Sing.
   - **Output**: “Mary sings.”

3. **Verb Selection**: Pick accurate verbs.

   - **Input**: Speed = Increase.
   - **Output**: “The car speeds up.”

4. **Contextual Adaptation**: Adjust for audience.

   - **Input**: Blood Pressure = 150/95 mmHg.
   - **General Audience**: “Your blood pressure is high.”
   - **Medical Audience**: “Blood pressure is 150/95 mmHg, indicating hypertension.”

5. **Pronoun Resolution**: Use pronouns to avoid repetition.
   - **Input**: John runs. John jumps.
   - **Output**: “John runs and he jumps.”

### 3.3 Real-World Examples

1. **Weather App**:

   - **Input**: Temp = 10°C.
   - **Output**: “It’s chilly at 10°C.”
   - **Why?** “Chilly” is vivid and relatable.

2. **E-commerce Chatbot**:

   - **Input**: Product = Phone, Price = $500.
   - **Output**: “This phone costs $500.”
   - **Why?** “This phone” is specific and engaging.

3. **Medical Report**:
   - **Input**: Glucose = 200 mg/dL.
   - **Output**: “Your blood sugar is high at 200 mg/dL.”
   - **Why?** “High” simplifies for patients.

### 3.4 Step-by-Step Lexicalization Process

**Scenario**: NLG for a health app.  
**Input Data**:

- Blood Pressure: 130/85 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 70 bpm
- Condition: Normal

**Steps**:

1. **Identify Concepts**: Blood pressure, heart rate, condition.
2. **Choose Words**:
   - Blood Pressure (130/85 mmHg): “Slightly elevated” (within normal but high-normal range).
   - Heart Rate (70 bpm): “Normal” (60–100 bpm is typical).
   - Condition: “Healthy” for general audience.
3. **Map to Text**:
   - “Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 130/85 mmHg.”
   - “Your heart rate is normal at 70 beats per minute.”
   - “Your condition is healthy.”
4. **Refine**: Combine for flow: “Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 130/85 mmHg, but your heart rate is normal at 70 bpm, indicating a healthy condition.”

**Output**: “Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 130/85 mmHg, but your heart rate is normal at 70 bpm, indicating a healthy condition.”

### 3.5 Visualization

Lexicalization is like a word-selection filter:

- **Input**: Data (e.g., Blood Pressure = 130/85 mmHg).
- **Process**: Map to words → Adjust for audience → Ensure naturalness.
- **Output**: Text (e.g., “Slightly elevated”).

**Diagram**:

```
[Blood Pressure: 130/85 mmHg]
           |
     [Choose: "slightly elevated"]
           |
[Output: "Your blood pressure is slightly elevated."]
```

## 4. Mathematical Foundations

While aggregation and lexicalization are often rule-based, math can optimize them, especially in research.

### 4.1 Aggregation: Optimization

Aggregation minimizes redundancy while retaining all information.  
**Math**:  
Let $$ D = \{d_1, d_2\} $$ (e.g., Temp = 18°C, Sky = Cloudy). Find a sentence $$ S $$ that:

- Minimizes **redundancy (R)** (e.g., repeated words like “is”).
- Ensures **information loss (L) = 0**.

**Equation**:  
$$ \min R(S) \quad \text{s.t.} \quad L(S) = 0 $$

**Example**:

- **Input**: $$ D = \{\text{Temp = 18°C}, \text{Sky = Cloudy}\} $$
- **Option 1**: $$ S_1 = \text{"It is 18°C. It is cloudy."} $$
  - $$ R = 2 $$ (repeats “It is”).
  - $$ L = 0 $$ (all info included).
- **Option 2**: $$ S_2 = \text{"It’s cloudy with a temperature of 18°C."} $$
  - $$ R = 0 $$ (no repetition).
  - $$ L = 0 $$ (all info included).  
    **Choose**: $$ S_2 $$.

### 4.2 Lexicalization: Probability

Lexicalization can use probabilities to pick words.  
**Math**: For a concept $$ C $$ (e.g., Temp = 25°C), choose word $$ w $$ from vocabulary $$ V $$ that maximizes:  
$$ w^\* = \arg\max\_{w \in V} P(w \mid C, \text{Context}) $$

**Example**:

- **Input**: Temp = 25°C, Context = Weather for Public.
- **Vocabulary**: $$ V = \{\text{warm, hot, mild}\} $$
- **Probabilities**:
  - $$ P(\text{warm} \mid 25^\circ\text{C}) = 0.6 $$
  - $$ P(\text{hot} \mid 25^\circ\text{C}) = 0.3 $$
  - $$ P(\text{mild} \mid 25^\circ\text{C}) = 0.1 $$  
    **Choose**: “warm.”

**Research Note**: Study probabilistic models (e.g., n-grams, transformers) to improve lexicalization in your experiments.
