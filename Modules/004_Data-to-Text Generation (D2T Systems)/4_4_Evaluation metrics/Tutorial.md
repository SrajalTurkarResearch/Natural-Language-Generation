## 1. What is NLG and Why Evaluate It?

### What is NLG?

NLG is when a computer generates text that reads like it was written by a human. Think of it as a robot author crafting a news summary, a chatbot answering questions, or a system writing product descriptions.

**Analogy**: Imagine NLG as a chef cooking a dish (the text). The ingredients are words, and the recipe is the model’s logic. The dish needs to taste good (be fluent), look appealing (be coherent), and meet the diner’s needs (be relevant).

### Why Evaluate NLG Systems?

We evaluate NLG to check if the text is:

- **Accurate**: Correct information.
- **Fluent**: Grammatically correct and natural.
- **Relevant**: Matches the user’s intent.
- **Diverse**: Creative and not repetitive.

Without evaluation, we can’t improve models or compare them scientifically. Metrics are like a scorecard for the chef’s dish.

### Types of Metrics

1. **Human Evaluation**: People read and score the text.
2. **Automatic Metrics**: Algorithms score the text by comparing it to a reference or analyzing its properties.

**Analogy**: Human evaluation is like a food critic tasting the dish. Automatic metrics are like a machine analyzing the ingredients and presentation.

## 2. Human Evaluation: The Gold Standard

### What is Human Evaluation?

Humans read the generated text and rate it based on criteria like fluency or relevance. It’s the most reliable method because humans catch nuances algorithms miss, like humor or tone.

### Criteria

- **Fluency**: Is the text grammatically correct and natural?
- **Coherence**: Does it make logical sense?
- **Relevance**: Does it address the prompt?
- **Informativeness**: Does it provide useful information?
- **Creativity**: Is it original or engaging?

**Example**:

- _Generated Text_: “This phone is awesome with a great camera and super fast.”
- _Human Scores_:
  - Fluency: 4/5 (natural but informal).
  - Coherence: 5/5 (logical).
  - Informativeness: 3/5 (lacks details).
  - Relevance: 5/5 (matches the task).

### Real-World Example

In 2023, a company tested a customer service chatbot. They asked 100 users to rate responses to “How do I return a product?” on a 1–5 scale for helpfulness and clarity. The chatbot scored 4.2/5 on average, but users noted it struggled with complex refund policies, leading to model improvements.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros**:

- Captures nuances like tone or cultural fit.
- Reflects real user experience.
  **Cons**:
- Time-consuming and expensive.
- Subjective (scores vary between evaluators).
- Hard to scale.

**Visual Idea**: Imagine a bar chart with bars for fluency, coherence, etc., showing average human scores. This highlights the model’s strengths and weaknesses.

## 3. Automatic Evaluation Metrics

Automatic metrics use algorithms to score text quickly and cheaply. They’re less nuanced but scalable. There are three main types: word-based, embedding-based, and others.

### Word-Based Metrics

#### BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)

- **What it Measures**: How many words or phrases (n-grams) in the generated text match a reference text.
- **How it Works**: Calculates precision (fraction of n-grams matching the reference) and adds a brevity penalty for short texts.
- **Range**: 0 to 1 (1 = perfect match).
- **Analogy**: BLEU is like checking if your dish uses the same ingredients as a reference recipe. It doesn’t check the “taste” (meaning).

**Example**:

- _Reference_: “The cat is on the mat.”
- _Generated_: “The cat sits on the mat.”
- BLEU counts matching n-grams (e.g., “the cat,” “on the mat”). Most words match, so the score is high but not perfect due to “sits” vs. “is.”

#### ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)

- **What it Measures**: How many n-grams in the reference appear in the generated text (focuses on recall).
- **Variants**: ROUGE-N (n-grams), ROUGE-L (longest common subsequence).
- **Range**: 0 to 1 (higher is better).
- **Analogy**: ROUGE checks how many of the reference recipe’s ingredients you used, even if you added extras.

**Example**:

- _Reference_: “The quick brown fox jumps.”
- _Generated_: “The brown fox jumps quickly.”
- ROUGE-N counts matching n-grams (e.g., “brown fox”). ROUGE-L looks for the longest matching sequence (“brown fox jumps”).

#### METEOR

- **What it Measures**: Matches words using exact matches, synonyms, and stems (e.g., “run” matches “running”), plus word order.
- **How it Works**: Uses WordNet for synonyms and penalizes poor word order.
- **Range**: 0 to 1.
- **Analogy**: METEOR is like a chef who checks if you used similar ingredients (e.g., basil vs. parsley) and arranged them well.

**Example**:

- _Reference_: “The dog runs fast.”
- _Generated_: “The puppy quickly runs.”
- METEOR matches “dog” with “puppy” (synonym) and “fast” with “quickly,” giving a higher score than BLEU.

### Embedding-Based Metrics

#### BERTScore

- **What it Measures**: Semantic similarity using BERT embeddings (numerical representations of meaning).
- **How it Works**: Converts words/sentences to vectors and computes cosine similarity.
- **Range**: Typically -1 to 1 (higher is better).
- **Analogy**: BERTScore compares the “flavor profile” of two dishes. Similar flavors (meanings) score high, even if ingredients differ.

**Example**:

- _Reference_: “The sun sets slowly.”
- _Generated_: “The sun gradually descends.”
- BERTScore gives a high score because “sets slowly” and “gradually descends” have similar meanings.

#### MoverScore

- **What it Measures**: Semantic distance using Word Mover’s Distance.
- **How it Works**: Measures the “effort” to transform one text’s embeddings into another’s.
- **Analogy**: Like moving ingredients between kitchens. Less effort means the texts are more similar.

### Other Metrics

#### Perplexity

- **What it Measures**: How predictable (fluent) the text is to a language model. Lower is better.
- **How it Works**: Based on the probability of a word sequence. High probability = low perplexity.
- **Analogy**: Like a teacher grading how naturally you speak. Predictable sentences score lower (better).

#### Distinct-n

- **What it Measures**: Diversity of text (ratio of unique n-grams).
- **How it Works**: Counts unique n-grams divided by total n-grams.
- **Range**: 0 to 1 (higher = more diverse).
- **Analogy**: Checks how many unique spices you used in a dish.

## 4. Math and Example Calculations

Let’s break down BLEU and ROUGE with full calculations to make the math clear.

### BLEU Calculation

BLEU combines n-gram precision with a brevity penalty.

**Formula**:

$$
\text{BLEU} = BP \cdot \exp\left( \sum_{n=1}^N w_n \log p_n \right)
$$

- $$p_n$$: Precision for n-grams.
- $$w_n$$: Weight (e.g., 0.25 for $$n=1$$ to $$4$$).
- $$BP$$: Brevity penalty, $$ \min\left(1, \frac{\text{len}_{\text{gen}}}{\text{len}_{\text{ref}}}\right) $$.

**Example**:

- _Reference_: “The cat is on the mat.”
- _Generated_: “The cat sits on the mat.”

**Step 1: Count N-grams**

- 1-grams (Ref): {The, cat, is, on, the, mat} (6 tokens).
- 1-grams (Gen): {The, cat, sits, on, the, mat} (6 tokens).
- 2-grams (Ref): {The cat, cat is, is on, on the, the mat} (5 pairs).
- 2-grams (Gen): {The cat, cat sits, sits on, on the, the mat} (5 pairs).

**Step 2: Precision**

- 1-gram: $$\frac{5}{6}$$ (all match except “sits”).
- 2-gram: $$\frac{4}{5}$$ (“cat sits” doesn’t match).

**Step 3: Brevity Penalty**

- Lengths equal (6 tokens), so $$BP = 1$$.

**Step 4: Combine**

- Weights: $$w_1 = w_2 = 0.5$$.
- $$
  \log\left(\frac{5}{6}\right) \approx -0.182
  $$
- $$
  \log\left(\frac{4}{5}\right) \approx -0.223
  $$
- $$
  0.5 \cdot (-0.182) + 0.5 \cdot (-0.223) = -0.2025
  $$
- $$
  \exp(-0.2025) \approx 0.817
  $$
- $$
  BLEU = 1 \cdot 0.817 = 0.817
  $$

**Result**: $$\text{BLEU} \approx 0.817$$

### ROUGE-1 Calculation

ROUGE-N measures recall.

**Formula**:

$$
\text{ROUGE-N} = \frac{\text{Overlapping n-grams}}{\text{Total n-grams in reference}}
$$

**Example**:

- _Reference_: “The quick brown fox jumps.”
- _Generated_: “The brown fox jumps quickly.”

**Step 1: 1-grams**

- Ref: {The, quick, brown, fox, jumps} (5 tokens).
- Gen: {The, brown, fox, jumps, quickly} (5 tokens).

**Step 2: Overlaps**

- Matches: {The, brown, fox, jumps} (4 tokens).

**Step 3: Recall**

$$
\text{ROUGE-1} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8
$$

**Result**: $$\text{ROUGE-1} = 0.8$$
