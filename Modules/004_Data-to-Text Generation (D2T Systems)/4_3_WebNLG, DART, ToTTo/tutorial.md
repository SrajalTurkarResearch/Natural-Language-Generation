# Tutorial: Understanding WebNLG, DART, and ToTTo in Natural Language Generation (NLG)

## 1. Introduction to NLG

### What is NLG?

Natural Language Generation (NLG) is like teaching a computer to tell stories from data. It’s a branch of AI where machines turn structured data (like tables or graphs) or unstructured data (like raw text) into human-readable text. Imagine you have a spreadsheet with weather data—NLG can transform it into a sentence like, “It’s sunny today with a high of 75°F.”

### Why Focus on WebNLG, DART, and ToTTo?

These three datasets are cornerstones in data-to-text NLG, where the input is structured data (like tables or knowledge graphs) and the output is coherent text. They’re widely used in research to train and test NLG models, making them perfect for you to learn as a budding scientist. Studying them will help you:

- Understand how to convert structured data into text.
- Build and evaluate NLG models.
- Explore real-world applications and research opportunities.

## 2. Structured Data Basics

### What is Structured Data?

Structured data is organized information, like a neatly arranged filing cabinet. It’s typically stored in formats like:

- **Tables**: Rows and columns, e.g., a spreadsheet listing names and ages.
- **RDF Triples**: Facts in the form of subject-predicate-object, e.g., “Einstein-born_in-Germany.”
- **Key-Value Pairs**: Simple mappings, e.g., “Temperature: 75°F.”

**Analogy**: Think of structured data as ingredients in a recipe card—each ingredient (data point) is clearly listed, and NLG is the chef who turns those ingredients into a delicious dish (text).

### The NLG Process

Data-to-text NLG involves two main steps:

1. **Content Selection**: Choosing which data to include. For example, from a weather dataset, you might pick only temperature and condition, ignoring wind speed.
2. **Surface Realization**: Turning the selected data into fluent, grammatically correct text.

**Analogy**: Content selection is like picking the best photos for a scrapbook, and surface realization is arranging them with captions to tell a story.

## 3. WebNLG: Deep Dive

### What is WebNLG?

WebNLG is a dataset for data-to-text NLG, created for the WebNLG challenge. It uses RDF triples from DBpedia (a structured version of Wikipedia) to generate text about people, places, organizations, and more.

### Structure

- **Input**: Sets of 1–7 RDF triples (e.g., “Alan_Bean-occupation-Astronaut”).
- **Output**: Natural language text describing the triples (e.g., “Alan Bean is an astronaut.”).
- **Test Split**:
  - **Seen Categories**: Triples from domains seen during training (e.g., Astronauts).
  - **Unseen Categories**: New domains to test model generalization (e.g., Monuments).
- **Size**: ~35,000 examples in WebNLG 2020.
- **Domains**: 15 categories, including Astronaut, City, University, etc.

### Example

**Input (RDF Triples)**:

- (Alan_Bean, occupation, Astronaut)
- (Alan_Bean, birthPlace, Wheeler_Texas)

**Output**:
“Alan Bean, an astronaut, was born in Wheeler, Texas.”

### Key Features

- **Multiple Triples**: Models must combine multiple facts into coherent text.
- **Referring Expressions**: Deciding when to use “Alan Bean” vs. “he.”
- **Generalization**: Handling unseen domains is a key challenge.

### Real-World Example

Imagine a news website auto-generating bios: “Elon Musk, a billionaire, founded SpaceX in 2002.” WebNLG’s triples could provide the facts, and an NLG model would create the sentence.

### Why It Matters for Research

WebNLG tests a model’s ability to generalize across domains, a critical skill for robust NLG systems. As a researcher, you can use it to explore how models handle complex structures or improve fluency.

## 4. DART: Deep Dive

### What is DART?

DART (Data-to-Text Generation with Open-Domain Structured Data) is a diverse dataset introduced in 2020. It combines data from WebNLG, Wikipedia tables, and other sources to create a challenging, open-domain corpus.

### Structure

- **Input**: RDF triples, often derived from tables or hierarchical “tree ontologies” (structured like a family tree).
- **Output**: Multi-sentence text, often longer and more complex than WebNLG.
- **Sources**: WebNLG, E2E dataset, Wikipedia tables, and human annotations.
- **Size**: 82,191 examples.

### Example

**Input (RDF Triples)**:

- (Empire_State_Building, height, 443.2_meters)
- (Empire_State_Building, location, New_York_City)

**Output**:
“The Empire State Building, located in New York City, has a height of 443.2 meters.”

### Key Features

- **Open-Domain**: Covers diverse topics, from buildings to sports.
- **Hierarchical Inputs**: Tree ontologies add complexity, requiring models to understand relationships.
- **Longer Outputs**: Often involves aggregation (combining facts into sentences).

### Real-World Example

A travel app could use DART to generate: “The Eiffel Tower, a 330-meter structure in Paris, was built in 1889,” from a mix of table data and triples.

### Why It Matters for Research

DART’s diversity makes it ideal for testing advanced models like T5 or BART on open-domain tasks. You can explore how models handle complex inputs or generate coherent multi-sentence texts.

## 5. ToTTo: Deep Dive

### What is ToTTo?

ToTTo (Table-to-Text) is a dataset introduced in 2020 for controlled table-to-text generation. It uses Wikipedia tables, with specific cells highlighted to guide what data to include in the output.

### Structure

- **Input**: A table with highlighted cells (indicating which data to use).
- **Output**: A single sentence describing the highlighted cells.
- **Size**: ~120,000 examples.

### Example

**Input (Table)**:
| Name | Nationality | Occupation |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Marie Curie | Polish | Scientist |

**Highlighted Cells**: Name, Occupation
**Output**:
“Marie Curie was a scientist.”

### Key Features

- **Controlled Generation**: Highlighted cells simplify content selection.
- **Realistic Data**: Reflects real-world table structures from Wikipedia.
- **Concise Outputs**: Focuses on single-sentence generation.

### Real-World Example

A sports app might use ToTTo to generate: “LeBron James scored 30 points last game,” by highlighting relevant cells in a stats table.

### Why It Matters for Research

ToTTo is perfect for studying content selection and concise text generation. You can use it to develop models that focus on precision and clarity.

## 8. Mathematical Foundations: BLEU Score

NLG models are evaluated using metrics like BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy), which measures how similar generated text is to a reference text. As a researcher, understanding BLEU is key to assessing model performance.

### BLEU Formula

$$
BLEU = BP \cdot \exp\left(\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n \log p_n\right)
$$

- **$p_n$**: Precision for n-grams (fraction of n-grams in generated text that match reference).
- **$w_n$**: Weight for each n-gram (e.g., 0.25 for $n=1$ to $4$).
- **$BP$**: Brevity penalty:

$$
BP =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } c > r \\
e^{1 - \frac{r}{c}} & \text{if } c \leq r
\end{cases}
$$

where $c$ is the generated text length, and $r$ is the reference text length.

### Example Calculation

**Reference**: “The Eiffel Tower is in Paris.”  
**Generated**: “Eiffel Tower is located in Paris.”

- **Unigram Precision ($p_1$)**:
  - Generated words: {Eiffel, Tower, is, located, in, Paris}
  - Matching words: {Eiffel, Tower, is, in, Paris} = 5
  - $$
    p_1 = \frac{5}{6} \approx 0.833
    $$
- **Bigram Precision ($p_2$)**:
  - Generated bigrams: {Eiffel Tower, Tower is, is located, located in, in Paris}
  - Matching bigrams: {Eiffel Tower, in Paris} = 2
  - $$
    p_2 = \frac{2}{5} = 0.4
    $$
- **Brevity Penalty**:
  - $c = 6$, $r = 5$
  - $$
    BP = e^{1 - \frac{5}{6}} = e^{0.1667} \approx 1.181
    $$
- **BLEU (N=2, $w_n = 0.5$)**:
  $$
  BLEU = 1.181 \cdot \exp(0.5 \cdot \log 0.833 + 0.5 \cdot \log 0.4)
  $$
  $$
  = 1.181 \cdot \exp(0.5 \cdot (-0.182) + 0.5 \cdot (-0.916))
  $$
  $$
  = 1.181 \cdot \exp(-0.549) \approx 1.181 \cdot 0.577 = 0.681
  $$

**BLEU Score**: ~68.1% (indicating moderate similarity).

This metric is used to evaluate models on WebNLG, DART, and ToTTo.

## 9. Practical Example with Code

Let’s build a simple NLG model using Python and the T5 model from Hugging Face to generate text from a WebNLG-like input.

### Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

### Code

```python
from transformers import T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration

# Load model and tokenizer
model_name = "t5-small"
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = T5ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_name)

# WebNLG-like input
input_triples = "Alan_Bean | occupation | Astronaut | birthPlace | Wheeler_Texas"
input_text = f"generate text: {input_triples}"

# Tokenize and generate
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt", max_length=512, truncation=True)
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_length=50, num_beams=5)
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print("Generated Text:", generated_text)
```

### Expected Output

“Generated Text: Alan Bean, an astronaut, was born in Wheeler, Texas.”

### Notes

- **Model**: T5 is a versatile transformer model. For real research, fine-tune it on WebNLG, DART, or ToTTo.
- **Input**: We formatted triples as a string for simplicity.
- **Research Tip**: Experiment with fine-tuning to improve accuracy.
