## 2. What is NLG and MR?

### 2.1 Natural Language Generation (NLG)

NLG is the process of turning structured data or abstract ideas into human-readable text. It’s like teaching a computer to “speak” by transforming raw information into sentences.

**Analogy**: Imagine NLG as a storyteller who takes a pile of facts (data) and weaves them into a coherent narrative (text). For example:

- **Input**: Data (temperature: 25°C, condition: sunny, location: New York)
- **Output**: “It’s sunny in New York with a temperature of 25°C.”

**Logic**: NLG bridges the gap between machine-readable data and human-understandable language, making it essential for applications like Rosanneau (chatbot), automated journalism, and more.

### 2.2 Meaning Representations (MR)

An MR is a structured, machine-readable format that captures the core meaning of a sentence or concept, independent of specific words or grammar. It’s like a blueprint that outlines the key ideas (who, what, where, how) without worrying about how to phrase them.

**Analogy**: Think of an MR as the “recipe” for a sentence. Just as a recipe lists ingredients and steps without specifying the exact cooking style, an MR lists the essential components of meaning (entities, actions, relationships) without tying them to a specific language.

**Example**:

- **Sentence**: “John eats an apple.”
- **MR**: `eat(John, apple)`
  - This captures the action (eat), the actor (John), and the object (apple).

**Why MRs Are Important**:

- They allow computers to understand and manipulate meaning universally.
- They enable NLG systems to generate text in different languages or styles from the same MR.
- They’re key for tasks like summarizing data or answering questions.

**Note for Your Notebook**: Write: “NLG = turning data into text. MR = structured meaning (like a recipe) that NLG uses to create sentences.” Jot down the example: `eat(John, apple)` → “John eats an apple.”

## 3. Types of Meaning Representations

MRs come in various formats, each suited for different tasks. Let’s explore the main ones with examples.

### 3.1 Semantic Frames

These represent events or situations with roles (like who, what, where), similar to filling out a form.

**Example**:

- **Sentence**: “Alice bought a book at the bookstore.”
- **MR**:
  ```
  Buy:
    - Agent: Alice
    - Theme: book
    - Location: bookstore
  ```

**Logic**: The frame organizes the event (“buy”) and its participants in a clear, structured way.

### 3.2 Predicate-Argument Structures

These focus on actions (predicates) and their arguments (entities involved), like a simplified equation.

**Example**:

- **Sentence**: “The cat chased the mouse.”
- **MR**: `chase(cat, mouse)`
  - **Predicate**: chase
  - **Arguments**: cat (subject), mouse (object)

### 3.3 Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR)

AMR uses a graph-based format to capture complex relationships between concepts, popular in research for its flexibility.

**Example**:

- **Sentence**: “The boy wants to eat pizza.”
- **MR**:
  ```
  (w / want-01
     :ARG0 (b / boy)
     :ARG1 (e / eat-01
              :ARG0 b
              :ARG1 (p / pizza)))
  ```

  - **Explanation**: The graph shows “want” as the main action, linked to the boy (who wants) and the action of eating pizza.

**Analogy**: AMR is like a mind map, with concepts as nodes connected by relationships.

### 3.4 Logical Forms

These use formal logic for precise reasoning, often in question-answering systems.

**Example**:

- **Sentence**: “All dogs bark.”
- **MR**: `∀x (dog(x) → bark(x))`
  - **Translation**: For all x, if x is a dog, then x barks.

**Note for Your Notebook**: List the MR types: Semantic Frames (event roles), Predicate-Argument (action + entities), AMR (graph-based), Logical Forms (logic-based). Try converting “Mary reads a book” into each:

- Frame: `Read: Agent: Mary, Theme: book`
- Predicate: `read(Mary, book)`
- AMR: `(r / read-01 :ARG0 (m / Mary) :ARG1 (b / book))`
- Logical Form: `read(Mary, book)`

## 4. How MRs Work in NLG

NLG systems use MRs as input to generate text through a pipeline:

1. **Content Planning**: Decide what to say (create the MR).
2. **Sentence Planning**: Organize the MR into a sentence structure.
3. **Surface Realization**: Choose words and grammar to create natural text.

**Analogy**: Building a house:

- **Content Planning**: Sketch the blueprint (MR).
- **Sentence Planning**: Plan the room layout (sentence structure).
- **Surface Realization**: Decorate the house (words and grammar).

**Example**:

- **Input**: Weather data (temperature: 20°C, condition: rainy, location: London)
- **Pipeline**:
  1. **MR**: `weather(location: London, condition: rainy, temperature: 20°C)`
  2. **Sentence Plan**: [Describe condition] in [location] with [temperature].
  3. **Output**: “It’s rainy in London with a temperature of 20°C.”

**Logic**: The MR captures core facts, which the NLG system maps to language-specific rules, allowing flexibility (e.g., formal: “The weather in London is rainy at 20°C” or casual: “London’s rainy at 20°C!”).

**Note for Your Notebook**: Sketch the pipeline: Content Planning → Sentence Planning → Surface Realization. Note that MRs are the “bridge” between data and text.

## 5. Mathematical Foundations

MRs can be formalized mathematically, especially for AMRs and logical forms. Let’s use an example to explore this.

### 5.1 Formalizing an MR

AMRs are often represented as **directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)**:

- **Nodes**: Concepts (e.g., actions, entities).
- **Edges**: Relationships (e.g., agent, theme).

**Example**:

- **Sentence**: “John loves Mary.”
- **MR (AMR)**:
  ```
  (l / love-01
     :ARG0 (j / John)
     :ARG1 (m / Mary))
  ```
- **Graph**: Nodes (`love-01`, `John`, `Mary`); Edges (`:ARG0` to `John`, `:ARG1` to `Mary`).

### 5.2 Calculation: MR to Text

Let’s convert the MR to text step-by-step:

1. **Parse MR**:
   - Root: `love-01` (main action).
   - Arguments: `ARG0 = John` (subject), `ARG1 = Mary` (object).
2. **Map to Structure**:
   - Template: [ARG0] loves [ARG1].
   - Substitute: John loves Mary.
3. **Apply Grammar**:
   - Ensure verb agreement (singular “loves”).
   - Add punctuation: “John loves Mary.”

**Logic Example**:

- Logical Form: `love(John, Mary)`
- Use for reasoning (e.g., Query: “Who loves Mary?” → Answer: `John`).

**Note for Your Notebook**: Draw the AMR graph for “John loves Mary” (nodes: love-01, John, Mary; edges: :ARG0, :ARG1). Write the steps: parse, map, grammar.

## 6. Real-World Applications

MRs power many NLG systems. Here are three examples:

### 6.1 Weather Reports

- **System**: BBC Weather app.
- **MR**: `weather(location: Paris, condition: cloudy, temperature: 15°C)`
- **Output**: “It’s cloudy in Paris with a temperature of 15°C.”
- **Why MR?**: Enables multilingual outputs (e.g., French: “Il fait nuageux à Paris avec 15°C”).

### 6.2 Sports Summaries

- **System**: Yahoo Sports.
- **MR**:
  ```
  score-event:
    - Team1: Barcelona
    - Team2: Real Madrid
    - Score: 2-1
    - Event: football match
  ```
- **Output**: “Barcelona defeated Real Madrid 2-1 in a football match.”
- **Why MR?**: Supports varied styles (e.g., short: “Barca wins 2-1”).

### 6.3 Virtual Assistants

- **System**: Siri answering questions.
- **Question**: “What’s the capital of France?”
- **MR**: `capital-of(country: France, city: Paris)`
- **Output**: “The capital of France is Paris.”
- **Why MR?**: Captures intent for accurate responses.

**Note for Your Notebook**: For each application, write the MR and output. Note how MRs enable flexibility across languages/styles.

## 7. Visualizations and Examples

Visuals clarify MRs. Let’s visualize an AMR for “The boy wants to eat pizza.”

**AMR**:

```
(w / want-01
   :ARG0 (b / boy)
   :ARG1 (e / eat-01
            :ARG0 b
            :ARG1 (p / pizza)))
```

**Visualization** (Sketch this):

```
   [want-01]
   /      \
:ARG0   :ARG1
  |        |
 [boy]    [eat-01]
           /    \
       :ARG0   :ARG1
         |       |
       [boy]   [pizza]
```

**Another Example**:

- **Sentence**: “The dog sleeps on the mat.”
- **MR (Frame)**:
  ```
  Sleep:
    - Agent: dog
    - Location: mat
  ```
- **Visualization**:
  ```
  [Sleep]
  /    \
  ```

Agent  Location
 |      |
[dog]  [mat]

```
- **Output**: “The dog sleeps on the mat.”

**Note for Your Notebook**: Draw both visualizations. Practice converting each MR to text.
