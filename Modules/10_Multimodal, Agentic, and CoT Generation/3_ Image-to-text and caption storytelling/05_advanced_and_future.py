# Advanced Topics and Future Directions
# This file explores advanced techniques, research frontiers, and what's missing in standard tutorials.

# Install: pip install matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# --- Advanced Theory ---
# Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): Models like LLaVA (2024) integrate vision and language for zero-shot captioning.
# Zero-Shot Triggers: TPCap (arXiv, 2025) uses triggers (special prompts) to caption new images without training.
# Visual Storytelling: BiLSTM models (2025 papers) handle narrative sequences better than Transformers for long stories.


# --- Visualization: Model Architecture ---
def plot_model_architecture():
    layers = [
        "Input Image",
        "CNN/ViT Encoder",
        "Attention Layer",
        "Transformer Decoder",
        "Output Caption",
    ]
    y = np.arange(len(layers))
    plt.barh(y, [1] * len(layers))
    plt.yticks(y, layers)
    plt.title("Image-to-Text Model Architecture")
    plt.show()


# --- What's Missing in Standard Tutorials ---
# - Ethics: Bias in captions (e.g., gender stereotypes in datasets).
# - Scalability: Distributed training for large datasets.
# - Multimodal Integration: Combining images with audio or video.
# - Rare Insight: Reinforcement learning (RL) with CIDEr rewards improves diversity.

# --- Future Directions ---
# - Video Captioning: Use 3D CNNs for temporal data.
# - Multilingual Captions: Support Hindi, Spanish, etc.
# - Quantum AI: Faster computation with quantum algorithms.
# - Research Tip: Propose a new RL reward function for creative storytelling.

# --- Exercise ---
# 1. Sketch a diagram of an encoder-decoder model on paper. Label CNN, attention, and Transformer.
# 2. Read the abstract of "Show and Tell" (2015) on arXiv. Summarize in 3 sentences.

# Run the code
