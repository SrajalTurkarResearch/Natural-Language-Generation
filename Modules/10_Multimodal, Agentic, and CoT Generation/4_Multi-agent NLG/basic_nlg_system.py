# basic_nlg_system.py
# A simple Multi-Agent NLG system for generating a weather report
# Purpose: Demonstrate core concepts of Multi-Agent NLG for beginners
# Author: Inspired by Turing, Einstein, and Tesla for aspiring scientists
# Prerequisites: Python 3.x

"""
This script implements a basic Multi-Agent NLG system with three agents:
- Data Agent: Collects weather data (simulated).
- Planning Agent: Structures the report.
- Generation Agent: Creates the text output.
Run this script to see a simple weather report and experiment by changing the city.
