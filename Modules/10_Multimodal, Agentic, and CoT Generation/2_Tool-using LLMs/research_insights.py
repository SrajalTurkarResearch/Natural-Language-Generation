Theory: Research Directions
-------------------------
Tool-using LLMs are evolving toward multimodal and agentic systems.
Key areas: Ethical NLG, quantum-enhanced models, open datasets.

Analogy (Turing-inspired): Like the halting problem, tools ensure LLMs terminate
with accurate outputs, bridging computability gaps.

Goal: Simulate a research experiment setup for tool-using NLG.
