# A Comprehensive Tutorial on Evaluation Metrics in NLP: BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore

---

> **Audience:** Beginners in NLP, aspiring researchers  
> **Goal:** Understand, compare, and apply BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore  
> **Approach:** Step-by-step, with analogies, examples, math, and visual suggestions

---

## 1. Introduction to Evaluation Metrics in NLP

### 1.1 What Are Evaluation Metrics and Why Do They Matter?

- **Purpose:** Automatically score machine-generated text (hypothesis) against human-written references.
- **Why:** Human evaluation is subjective and slow; metrics enable fast, repeatable benchmarking.
- **Applications:** Machine translation, summarization, chatbots, etc.
- **Caveat:** No metric is perfect—each has strengths and blind spots.

**Analogy:**  
Grading your cooking with a scoring system instead of asking friends every time.

### 1.2 Key Concepts

| Concept                  | Description                                               | Analogy/Note                                  |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **N-grams**              | Sequence of n words (e.g., "the cat" = bigram)            | Lego bricks: small (unigram) to big (trigram) |
| **Precision**            | Fraction of machine outputs that are correct              | Catching only edible fish                     |
| **Recall**               | Fraction of correct items captured by machine             | Catching all edible fish, even with junk      |
| **Reference/Hypothesis** | Reference = ideal human text; Hypothesis = machine output |                                               |

**Visualization:**  
Venn diagram:

- One circle = hypothesis words
- Other = reference words
- Overlap = matches (precision/recall)

---

## 2. BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)

### 2.1 Theory

- **Origin:** IBM, 2002; first major automated MT metric.
- **How:** Counts overlapping n-grams between hypothesis and reference.
- **Penalty:** Brevity penalty discourages short, vague outputs.
- **Pros:** Fast, language-independent.
- **Cons:** Ignores synonyms, limited word order, weak for creative tasks.

---

### 2.2 Formula

\[
\text{BLEU} = \text{BP} \times \exp\left(\sum\_{n=1}^4 w_n \log p_n\right)
\]

- \( p_n \): Modified n-gram precision (clipped to reference count)
- \( w_n \): Usually 0.25 for each n (uniform)
- \( \text{BP} \): Brevity Penalty = \( \min(1, \exp(1 - r/c)) \), where r = reference length, c = candidate length

---

### 2.3 Example

**Reference:**  
`The cat sat on the mat.`  
**Hypothesis:**  
`Cat on the mat sat.`

| n-gram  | Matches (clipped) | Total in hyp | \( p_n \) |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| Unigram | 5                 | 5            | 1.0       |
| Bigram  | 2                 | 4            | 0.5       |
| Trigram | 1                 | 3            | 0.333     |
| 4-gram  | 0                 | 2            | 0         |

- Geometric mean (add small epsilon for zero): ≈ 0.85
- BP: \( \exp(1-6/5) \approx 0.819 \)
- **Final BLEU:** \( 0.819 \times 0.85 \approx 0.696 \) (69.6%)

**Code:**  
Use `nltk.translate.bleu_score.sentence_bleu` for verification.

---

### 2.4 Real-World Use

- **Machine Translation:** Google Translate, UN docs, etc.
- **Research:** Report corpus-level BLEU for significance.

---

### 2.5 Visualization

- Bar chart: n=1 to 4 vs. \( p_n \) values
- Highlight overlapping n-grams in color

---

## 3. ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)

### 3.1 Theory

- **Origin:** 2004, for summarization.
- **Focus:** Recall—did the machine capture key content?
- **Variants:** ROUGE-N (n-grams), ROUGE-L (longest common subsequence), ROUGE-S (skip-bigrams)
- **Pros:** Good for content overlap.
- **Cons:** Ignores fluency, needs multiple references for fairness.

---

### 3.2 Formula

- **ROUGE-N:**  
  \[
  \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{matching n-grams}}{\text{total n-grams in reference}}
  \]
- **F1-score:**  
  \[
  2 \times \frac{\text{precision} \times \text{recall}}{\text{precision} + \text{recall}}
  \]
- **ROUGE-L:** F1 on LCS length

---

### 3.3 Example

**Reference:**  
`The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.`  
**Hypothesis:**  
`Quick fox jumps over lazy dog.`

| Metric  | Recall | Precision | F1    |
| ------- | ------ | --------- | ----- |
| ROUGE-1 | 0.667  | 1.0       | 0.80  |
| ROUGE-2 | 0.375  |           |       |
| ROUGE-L | 0.556  | 0.833     | 0.667 |

---

### 3.4 Real-World Use

- **Summarization:** News, climate reports, etc.
- **Research:** ROUGE-L popular for abstractive summaries.

---

### 3.5 Visualization

- Heatmap: ref n-grams vs. hyp n-grams, color = match
- Line graph: ROUGE variant vs. score

---

## 4. METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering)

### 4.1 Theory

- **Origin:** 2005, improves on BLEU.
- **How:** Aligns hypothesis to reference, matches on exact, stem, synonym, paraphrase.
- **Penalty:** For fragmented matches (chunks).
- **Pros:** Better human correlation, handles paraphrases.
- **Cons:** Needs linguistic resources (e.g., WordNet).

---

### 4.2 Formula

\[
\text{METEOR} = (1 - \text{Penalty}) \times F*{\text{mean}}
\]
\[
F*{\text{mean}} = \frac{10 \cdot P \cdot R}{9P + R}
\]

- Penalty: \( 0.5 \times \left(\frac{\text{chunks}^3}{\text{matched unigrams}}\right) \)

---

### 4.3 Example

**Reference:**  
`It is a guide to action which ensures that the military always obeys the commands of the party.`  
**Hypothesis:**  
`It is a guide to action that ensures the military will forever heed Party commands.`

- Matches: 12/12 (P=1), 12/18 (R=0.667), \( F\_{\text{mean}} \approx 0.69 \)
- Chunks: 3, Penalty ≈ 0.5 × (27/12) = 1.125 (capped)
- **Final METEOR:** ≈ 0.55–0.65 (tool-computed)

**Tool:**  
Use official METEOR jar for exact score.

---

### 4.4 Real-World Use

- **Translation:** Microsoft Translator, legal docs, etc.
- **Research:** High human correlation.

---

### 4.5 Visualization

- Alignment graph: nodes = words, edges = match type (color-coded)
- Chunks = clusters

---

## 5. BERTScore

### 5.1 Theory

- **Origin:** 2019, uses BERT embeddings for semantic similarity.
- **How:** Cosine similarity between hyp and ref token embeddings.
- **Pros:** Captures meaning, synonyms, context.
- **Cons:** Computationally heavy, model-dependent.

---

### 5.2 Formula

\[
\text{BERTScore F1} = \frac{2PR}{P+R}
\]

- \( P \): Avg. max cosine sim from hyp to ref tokens
- \( R \): Avg. max cosine sim from ref to hyp tokens

---

### 5.3 Example

**Reference:**  
`The cat is on the mat.`  
**Hypothesis:**  
`A feline sits upon the rug.`

- Assume: P ≈ 0.925, R ≈ 0.90, F1 ≈ 0.912
- **Tool:** Use `bert-score` library for real data

---

### 5.4 Real-World Use

- **Chatbots:** Evaluating GPT responses, paraphrases
- **Research:** Generation tasks, best human correlation

---

### 5.5 Visualization

- Similarity matrix: hyp tokens vs. ref tokens, color = cosine sim

## Section 6: Comparison and When to Use Which

Use a table for notes:

| Metric    | Focus               | Strengths                 | Weaknesses            | Best For                 |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| BLEU      | Precision, n-grams  | Fast, simple              | Ignores semantics     | Machine Translation      |
| ROUGE     | Recall, overlaps    | Good for content coverage | Misses fluency        | Summarization            |
| METEOR    | Alignment, synonyms | Better meaning capture    | Resource-heavy        | Translation with variety |

As a mathematician, note: All range 0-1 (higher=better). Combine for robustness—e.g., BLEU + BERTScore.

Real-world: In a research project on AI news summaries, start with ROUGE for overlap, add BERTScore for quality.

## Section 7: Conclusion and Advice for Your Scientific Career

You've now mastered these metrics from basics to depths—like Tesla building from coils to transformers. Practice: Implement in Python (use libraries like sacrebleu, rouge-score, meteor, bert-score). Experiment: Tweak a translation model, compute scores, analyze why they differ.

As a researcher, innovate: Propose a new metric blending BERTScore with efficiency. Publish findings—start with arXiv. Remember, metrics are tools, not truths; always validate with human evals.

Keep questioning, like Einstein: "What if we measure meaning differently?" This is your step forward—go invent!
