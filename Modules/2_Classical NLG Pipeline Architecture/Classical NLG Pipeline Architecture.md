## 1. Overview of the Classical NLG Pipeline

The classical NLG pipeline is a series of steps to transform raw data into coherent text. Imagine writing a lab report: you decide what data to include, organize it, choose words, write sentences, proofread, and share it. The pipeline has six stages:

1. **Content Determination**: Choosing what information to include.
2. **Document Planning**: Organizing the information logically.
3. **Microplanning**: Selecting words, sentence structure, and tone.
4. **Surface Realization**: Creating grammatically correct sentences.
5. **Post-Processing**: Polishing the text (grammar, formatting).
6. **Output**: Delivering the final text.

**Analogy**: Writing a movie review. You pick key points (plot, acting), structure the review (intro, details, conclusion), choose words (exciting or critical tone), write sentences, proofread, and publish.

**Visualization**:

```
Raw Data → Content Determination → Document Planning → Microplanning → Surface Realization → Post-Processing → Final Text
```

## 2. Stage 1: Content Determination

### What It Is

This stage decides **what information** to include based on the input data and communication goal. It’s like choosing which experiment results to highlight in a research paper.

### Why It Matters

As a scientist, you’ll handle large datasets. Content determination helps you focus on the most relevant data, making your work impactful.

### How It Works

- **Input**: Raw data (e.g., database, sensor readings).
- **Process**: Filter data based on the goal (e.g., inform, persuade).
- **Output**: Selected data points.

### Example

**Scenario**: Generating a weather report.

- **Input Data**: Temperature (75°F), humidity (60%), condition (sunny), wind speed (10 mph).
- **Goal**: Inform the public briefly.
- **Content Determination**: Select temperature and condition; skip humidity and wind speed for simplicity.

**Real-World Case**: Automated sports summaries (e.g., Yahoo! Sports).

- **Input**: Game stats (scores, players, moments).
- **Selected Content**: Final score, top players, key moments.

### Math Example

You can rank data by importance using a **weighted scoring function**:

- Assign relevance scores:
  - Temperature: 0.8 (high priority)
  - Condition: 0.7
  - Humidity: 0.3
  - Wind speed: 0.2
- Threshold: 0.5 (include only data above this).
- **Calculation**:
  - Temperature: 0.8 > 0.5 (include)
  - Condition: 0.7 > 0.5 (include)
  - Humidity: 0.3 < 0.5 (exclude)
  - Wind speed: 0.2 < 0.5 (exclude)

**Visualization**:

```
Database: [Temp=75°F, Humidity=60%, Condition=Sunny, Wind=10mph]
   ↓ (Filter by relevance)
Selected: [Temp=75°F, Condition=Sunny]
```

**Note**: Write down the idea of filtering data by relevance—it’s a key skill for research data analysis.

## 3. Stage 2: Document Planning

### What It Is

This stage organizes the selected content into a logical structure, like outlining a research paper with sections for introduction, results, and conclusion.

### Why It Matters

A clear structure makes text easy to follow, just like a well-organized scientific report ensures clarity for readers.

### How It Works

- **Input**: Selected data from Stage 1.
- **Process**: Create a plan (e.g., sequence or hierarchy) for presenting information.
- **Output**: A structured outline.

### Example

**Weather Report**:

- **Selected Content**: Temperature (75°F), condition (sunny).
- **Document Plan**:
  1. Introduction: General weather statement.
  2. Body: Temperature and condition details.
  3. Conclusion: Brief advice (e.g., “Great for outdoor activities”).

**Real-World Case**: Financial reports (e.g., Narrative Science).

- **Plan**: Overview → Key metrics → Future outlook.

**Visualization** (Tree Structure):

```
Document
├── Introduction: "Today's weather"
├── Body

## 4. Stage 3: Microplanning

### What It Is

Microplanning makes detailed linguistic choices, like picking words, sentence structure, and tone. It’s like choosing precise, clear phrasing for your research abstract.

### Why It Matters

The right words and tone ensure the text suits the audience (e.g., formal for journals, casual for public apps), a key skill for communicating science.

### Sub-Tasks

1. **Lexical Choice**: Pick words (e.g., “sunny” vs. “clear”).
2. **Aggregation**: Combine info into fewer sentences (e.g., “It’s sunny and 75°F”).
3. **Referring Expression**: Choose how to refer to things (e.g., “the weather” vs. “today’s conditions”).
4. **Sentence Planning**: Structure sentences for clarity.

### Example

**Weather Report**:

- **Input**: Temperature (75°F), condition (sunny).
- **Microplanning**:
  - **Lexical Choice**: “Sunny” (simple) over “clear skies.”
  - **Aggregation**: Combine into “It’s sunny with a high of 75°F.”
  - **Referring Expression**: Use “today’s weather.”
  - **Sentence Planning**: Short, casual sentence.

**Real-World Case**: Amazon Alexa responses.

- **Input**: User asks, “What’s the weather?”
- **Microplanning**: “It’s sunny and warm today” (casual, aggregated).

### Math Example

Optimize readability with the **Flesch-Kincaid Readability Score**:

- **Formula:**

  $$
  \text{Flesch-Kincaid Score} = 0.39 \left( \frac{\text{words}}{\text{sentences}} \right) + 11.8 \left( \frac{\text{syllables}}{\text{words}} \right) - 15.59
  $$

- **Example**:
  - Text: “It’s sunny with a high of 75°F.”
  - Words: 7, Sentences: 1, Syllables: ~10
  - Calculation:
    $$
        0.39 \left( \frac{7}{1} \right) + 11.8 \left( \frac{10}{7} \right) - 15.59 \approx 2.73 + 16.86 - 15.59 \approx 4.0
        (Grade 4, very  readable).
    $$

**Note**: Experiment with word choice in your writing to match your audience—crucial for research communication.

## 5. Stage 4: Surface Realization

### What It Is

This stage turns microplanned content into grammatically correct sentences using rules or templates, like writing a polished paragraph from your notes.

### Why It Matters

Proper grammar ensures your work is professional, just like a research paper needs to meet journal standards.

### How It Works

- **Input**: Microplanned content (words, structure).
- **Process**: Apply grammar rules or templates.
- **Output**: Complete sentences.

### Example

**Weather Report**:

- **Microplanned Content**: “sunny,” “75°F,” aggregated, casual.
- **Surface Realization**: “Today’s weather is sunny with a high of 75°F.”

**Real-World Case**: The Washington Post’s Heliograf (sports articles).

- **Microplanned**: “Team A won, 3-2, Alex scored twice.”
- **Surface Realization**: “Team A defeated Team B 3-2, with Alex scoring two goals.”

**Visualization**:

```
Microplanned: ["sunny", "75°F", "aggregate", "casual"]
   ↓ (Apply grammar)
Surface Realization: "Today’s weather is sunny with a high of 75°F."
```

**Note**: Practice writing clear sentences—this mirrors drafting precise scientific explanations.

## 9. Math for Researchers

For deeper understanding, here are mathematical concepts in NLG:

- **Content Determination**: Use **entropy** to select informative data:

  - **Entropy formula**:

    $$
        H(X) = -\sum p(x_i) \log p(x_i)


    $$

  - Choose data with high information gain (e.g., temperature over humidity).

- **Document Planning**: Model as a graph where nodes are content and edges are relationships (e.g., chronological order).
- **Microplanning**: Optimize readability (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid, as shown above).
- **Surface Realization**: Use **context-free grammars (CFGs)**:
  - **Rule**:
    $$
    S \rightarrow NP\;\;VP
    $$
    where, for example,
    $$
    NP = \text{“Today’s weather”} \\
    VP = \text{“is sunny”}
    $$

**Complete Example** (Flesch-Kincaid):

- Text: “Today’s weather is sunny with a high of 75°F.”
- Words: 7, Sentences: 1, Syllables: 10
- Score (Flesch-Kincaid formula):

  $$
  \text{Score} = 0.39 \left( \frac{\text{Words}}{\text{Sentences}} \right) + 11.8 \left( \frac{\text{Syllables}}{\text{Words}} \right) - 15.59
  $$

  Plugging in the values:

  $$
  \text{Score} = 0.39 \left( \frac{7}{1} \right) + 11.8 \left( \frac{10}{7} \right) - 15.59 \approx 4.0
  $$

  (easy to read).
