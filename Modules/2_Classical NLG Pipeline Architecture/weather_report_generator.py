# weather_report_generator.py
# Mini Project: Generate weather reports using the Classical NLG Pipeline
# Designed for beginners to practice NLG

# Install required libraries: pip install pandas
import pandas as pd

# Sample dataset
data = pd.DataFrame(
    {
        "day": ["Monday", "Tuesday"],
        "temperature": [75, 80],
        "condition": ["sunny", "cloudy"],
        "humidity": [60, 65],
        "wind_speed": [10, 15],
    }
)
